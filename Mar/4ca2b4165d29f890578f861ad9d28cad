IBADAN – A renowned Islamic lecturer, Sheikh (Dr.) Muhydeen Ajani Bello has cautioned political gladiators across the country to shun any form of violence. Rather, he urged them to embrace peace and love in their dealings. The popular Islamic lecturer affirmed that God honoured whom he pleases with wealth and positions of authority, irrespective of who they are. Sheikh Bello made this call on Tuesday in Ibadan, Oyo state capital, during the 20th Gbolarumi Annual Special Ramadan Lecture. The annual Ramadan lecture with the theme; ‘Allah Gives Authority to Whom HE Pleases,’ was organised by the former deputy governor of the state, Barrister Hazeem Gbolarumi who doubles as the Balogun Adinni of Ibadanland and Mogaji of Olugbesan family. Bello in his lecture said: “God gives power to whoever that pleases Him irrespective of their religion, political affiliation or background. “I’m using this medium to call on all politicians across the country to stop fighting one another over political power because all powers belong to God and He gives whom He pleases. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “I’m urging politicians, especially the political gladiators in Oyo state to embrace peace, there is need for them to shun any forms of violence, and love one another, power and positions of authority belong to God.” POLL Earlier in his welcome remarks, Alhaji Hazeem Gbolarumi, the convener of the lecture, stressed that the 20th annual lecture was in memory of 15th year remembrance of Late Alhaji Lamidi Ariyibi Adedibu and the ninth-year remembrance of Late Alhaji Abdul-Azeez Arisekola Aloa. Gbolarumi used the event to hold a special prayer for the souls of his late political leaders, late Alhaji Adedibu and Alhaji Arisekola. He described the late leaders as iconic leaders and narrated how he singlehandedly facilitated the annual Ramadan lecture 20 years ago with the support of the two leaders.
