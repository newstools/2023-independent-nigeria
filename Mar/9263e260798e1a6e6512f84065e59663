P/HARCOURT – In the light of the ongoing legal battle, the Rivers State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt has received final address and reply from claimants and defendants respectively, involved in a land dispute by top major companies in the state. The land case is in Suit No: PHC/158/CS/2022 between Ibeto Energy Development Limited, Chief Cletus Ibeto (claimants) and Dozzy Oil and Gas, Sir Daniel Chukwudozie, and Sungreen Oil and Gas Limited (defendants). At the resumed hearing, counsel for the defendants, Emmanuel Ukala, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), drew the attention of the court to the claimants’ final address on the subject matter which borders on land dispute between the two parties. Ukala, responding to the claimants’ final address dated March 17, 2023, noted that under paragraph four, the claimants devoted substantial time and energy seeking to show that they had established their title over the land in dispute citing several decisions of the court which are not applicable in the circumstances of the present case.
