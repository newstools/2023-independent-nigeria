Senior Magistrate A.S Muhammed stated that, the rulling on the case with file number MCIA/674C/2019 was in connection with his reflection on the provisions of Criminal justice Law(2018), as well as section 417(2)d of the Kwara State Administration of Criminal Justice Law, 2018. Hillcrest Agro Allied Company Limited had through Samson Adedotun (a staff of the Company) written a petition to the Commisioner of Police, Kwara State Command on alleged Libelous Publication tagged ‘Kwara Factory where Indian hemp smoking is legalised’ published on the 26th March 2018 by the two defendants.

The kwara State Police Command, however, through sgt. Ayodele, a Police Officer and investigating Police Officer attached to the State Criminal Investigation and intelligence department (CIID) upon investigation, prosecuted the duo owing to their acknowledgement and admissibilty of the Libelous Publication with no substantial evidence.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Hence, the Magistrate sentenced the duo to five months imprisonment or a fine of 100,000 each on a case of two count charge of Conspiracy and Defamation of Character.
