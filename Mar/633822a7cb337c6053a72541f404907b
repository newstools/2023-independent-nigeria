Shittu noted that he could not have congratulated Mutfwang, the Governor-elect when already a petition challenging the result of the election was before the tribunal in Jos. He alleged that the just concluded governorship election in Plateau was not all about Nentawe, but the collective will of the people of the state who have entrusted their aspirations to him. The campaign spokesman hinted that though the leader of the struggle, Nentawe is not authoritarian, and such could not have congratulated Mutfwang without due consultation and approval of his teeming supporters and that of his party. Shittu maintained that as democrat, Nentawe believes in following all legitimate ways in seeking redress where his rights and those of his people have been infringed upon.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ According to him, by going to the tribunal, Nentawe is only availing himself of one of the electoral processes as enshrined in the Electoral Act. POLL Shittu urged the people of the state to disregard the purported congratulatory message and await the decision of the tribunal on the result of the governorship election.
