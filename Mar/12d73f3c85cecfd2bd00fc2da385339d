LAGOS – The Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) has once again, reiterated, that those who break its official seal on any building, could be regarded as ‘criminals’. Arch.Gbolahan Oki the General Manager of LASBCA, stated this in an interview with Daily Independent. According to him, for some time now, some developers and owners of some structures hitherto sealed by officials of the agency have gone back to site by illegally breaking these seals without recourse to the agency. Oki who was visibly angry, frowned at this ‘untoward’ behaviour, describing it ‘criminal’. His words: “We have observed for some time now, that some developers and owners of buildings and structures sealed by our officials after serving various notices for compliances have returned to site after unlawfully breaking the seals. “This development is not only worrisome but has continued to affect the optimal performance of our field officials because it has slowed down the monitoring process”. The General Manager was of the opinion, that more Physical Development Inspection (PDI) personnel needed to be employed in order yo be able to effectively monitor the numerous building developments going on in the state.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He said that the agency had been able to identify distressed buildings I’m the state with a view to bringing such structures down in line with the state’s laid down regulations guiding building development.
