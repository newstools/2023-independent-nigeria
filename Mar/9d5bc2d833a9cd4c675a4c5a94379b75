9 Payment Service Bank (9PSB) has embarked on a school mentoring campaign engaging and educating young Nigerians on the need to invest and invest wisely. The payment system bank had mentored students at three different locations – Ajao Estate Senior Grammar School, Isolo, Lagos; Wuse Comprehensive Secondary School, Abuja; and Kano Capital Girls Secondary School, Kano to mark the 2023 Global Money Week being championed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), to bring financial literacy and education to students in the mentored schools. Branka Mracajac, the Chief Executive Officer of 9 Payment Service Bank (9PSB), while delivering her lecture at the event which was woven around the theme of the Global Money Week: ‘Plan your Money, Plant your Future,’ noted that, financial literacy has become a necessity for everyone particularly the youths in this digital age, in order to prepare them for making informed decisions especially in matters relating to money, savings and investment, thereby preparing them for the future. Speaking on the basic principles of money, the savings culture, and budgeting, she said: “it is important to spend your money wisely. One of the ways to help you spend your money wisely is to make a budget. To make a budget, you need money. So, you plan on how to split your costs into wants and needs. It is important to carefully distinguish between what we truly need and what we merely desire, to properly plan and manage a budget.” Highlighting the need to grow money through investment and the dangers of wrong or uninformed investments, Mracajac emphasised the need to invest in proper channels and include a financial plan in order to avoid bankruptcy.
