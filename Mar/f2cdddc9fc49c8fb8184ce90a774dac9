The Udu of Isoko Nation and Managing Director/ Chief Executive/CEO of the Delta State Oil Produc­ing Areas Development Commission, DESOPA­DEC, Bashorun Askia Ogieh JP, has condoled with the people of Olomu Kingdom in Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State over the transi­tion to the great beyond of their centenarian mon­arch. The Ohworode of Olo­mu, His Royal Majesty, Ovie Richard Layeguen Ogbon, Ogoni-Oghoro 1, joined his ancestors on Friday March 17, 2023, at age 106. “The late monarch was highly respected across the length and breath of Del­ta State and Nigeria as he continued to provide lead­ership and direction to gov­ernments, institutions and communities until his last day and he was recognised worldwide for his works in the vineyard of God as the only Royal Canon of the Church of Nigeria (Angli­can Communion), a posi­tion which was also well respected by the Church of England. “The demise of the mon­arch is a personal loss to me because he took me as a son. He checked on me and prayed for me everyday and shared in all of my joyful and happy moments. “However, rather than grieve, we should cele­brate a life well spent and I urge our brothers and sisters of Olomu kingdom to take comfort in the fact that our father was blessed with long life and strength and he led the people in wisdom, dignity, peace and progress.”
