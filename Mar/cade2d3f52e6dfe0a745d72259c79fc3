In a bid to bridge the gap in social protection intervention, the Lagos State Government has been urged to establish a framework that is gender-sensitive and age appropriate and inclusive of persons with disability to ensure a minimum social floor for all Lagos residents for a life of dignity. The government was also urged to ensure that social protection law is passed for an agency to be given the autonomy to implement initiatives beyond the lifespan of any particular administration. This call came last Wednesday as the Socio-Economic Rights &Accountability Project (SERAP) held a two-day CSOs review meeting on the effective mechanism for promoting Accountability for Social Protection in Lagos State. During the presentation of the research findings by Mr Temidayo Omoju, a senior program officer at SERAP, the organization noted that social assistance and social insurance schemes are two critical social Protection concepts and objectives that must be achieve to reach the goal of caring for the poor and vulnerable and ensure that citizens are lifted out of poverty and attain to a life of dignity. Omoju added that the research work is the first ever analysis of social protection intervention in Lagos State and it is one of the early efforts to identify the critical implementation gaps, and make visible the barriers that have hindered a robustimplementation.He said it is also aimed at providing the information needed to initiate and drive a citizens led accountability mechanism for holding government to account for social protection. “The Lagos State in order to address the challenges of poverty introduced the Social Protection Programmes as a component in the ‘Lagos State Development Plan (LSDP) between 2012-2015.The research however noted that programmes which run essentially as social assistance projects are limited in scope, implemented in ad-hoc basis and lack of coordination and continuing due mainly to the absence of of a policy framework to guide the implementation of social protection in Lagos State.” Also, the research noted the importance of data collation whereby the data of beneficiaries will be disaggregated to ensure that the most vulnerable are the beneficiaries of the initiatives.“This is needed to ensure that the rightclients are serviced in the State. This includes increasing accessibility to the office of LASODA for registration, digitalizing the registration process, and reviewing the process of distribution of the various disability intervention funds, where that is necessary.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “The Civil Society Organization (CSOs) also need to closely monitor spending from Lagos State Office Of Disability Affairs (LASODA) so as to promote inclusion of People With Disability (PWDs) in social protection intervention.There is an opportunity for the SPCD to add value to LASODA’s annual spending and check the deliverables against theSocial Protection Monitoring Evaluation Accountability and Learning Plan.Also, Policy Objective four on Market Intervention is an opportunity to have LASG mature in social protection intervention that should reach the grassroot communities. COs and other stakeholders should turn attention to these opportunities to trigger investment in these policy measures. POLL The research also stated that the key campaignable issues raised during the field consultations include how the MDAs are driving the message of social protection to the rural communities in Lagos State? What future projects should influence campaigns in the local communities.Meanwhile, part of the recommendations stated that success can only be achieved in the implementation of Social Protection in the State if some of the issues raised in the research work are adequately addressed.
