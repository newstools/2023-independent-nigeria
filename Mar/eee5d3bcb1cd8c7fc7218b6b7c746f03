Civil rights advocacy group, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, (HURIWA), on Thursday, said there is nothing wrong in applying legal means to stop the inauguration of the President-Elect, Bola Tinubu on May 29, 2023 because the February 25, 2023 election that produced him is still being actively challenged in court by leading candidates in the poll. HURIWA, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwu­biko, said the so-called alarm raised by the Department of State Services (DSS) on Wednesday that some pol­iticians are plotting an in­terim government should not be used as an obstacle to stop the petitions filed by Atiku Abubakar of the Peo­ples Democratic Party (PDP) and Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP). The DSS warning fol­lowed a petition by the Min­ister of State for Labour and Productivity, Festus Keyamo that the DSS invited Obi and his running mate, Datti Ba­ba-Ahmed, over their rejec­tion of Tinubu as the Presi­dent-Elect. Similarly, Atiku had ear­lier in March led a protest to the Abuja office of the Inde­pendent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to reject the result of the February 25 poll declared by the electoral umpire. Both Atiku and Obi al­leged electoral malpractices in the poll and are in court to challenge the declaration of Tinubu as President-Elect by INEC. HURIWA’s Onwubiko said, “The Department of State Services should not rope in powerful opposi­tion forces such as Peter Obi and Atiku Abubakar with a view to finding some frivolous charges to hang on their necks to frustrate their formidable petitions against the outcome of the February 25 presidential poll.
