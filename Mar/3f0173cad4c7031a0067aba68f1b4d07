Prof. Nnenna Oti, Return­ing Officer for the Abia State governorship election, has confessed that she was offered bribe to manipulate the elec­tion. Exactly a week ago, Alex Otti of Labour Party (LP) was declared winner of the gover­norship poll. According to the results announced at the Indepen­dent National Electoral Com­mission’s (INEC) head office in Abia, Otti polled 175,467 votes to defeat Okey Ahiwe of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who was his clos­est challenger. Ahiwe scored 88,529 votes. Speaking while being wel­comed by the staff and students of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Oti, who is the Vice Chancellor, said before the final declaration of the result, she was promised huge monetary inducement to change the will of Abia people. “As an electoral officer, I have never in my life partici­pated in any election, but duty came calling, I made my enqui­ries from Abuja,” Oti said. “If I perish, I perish, they came with their threats, they came with their money, they came with their intimida­tion.” She stated that she stood on her ideals and principles not to short-change anyone and ensured that the will of the peo­ple of Abia prevailed and that their votes counted during the election.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “I didn’t start today; I stand here before God, Jesus Christ. I have never defrauded anyone, all I did was to declare the riot act as follows: Under me, votes must count, under me, the peo­ple’s mandate will be upheld because I, Professor Nnnena Oti, can never do evil,” she said. POLL INEC had suspended colla­tion of the election results after thugs overran one of its offices in Abia. The Returning Officer and some key electoral officials were summoned to Abuja over the controversy.
