The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Imo State Chapter, has lauded Gover­nor Hope Uzodimma of the State, for his massive infra­structural transformation within three years in office describing the feat as unprec­edented. In a statement in Owerri on Thursday, the Chairman of the Association, Rev (Dr.) Etches Divine Etches, said the Christian body is not surprised at the governor’s uncommon achievements, because as the scripture says, “when the righteous are in power, the people rejoice.” “This Biblical passage sums up the affairs since Senator Hope Uzodimma as­sumed office as the Governor of Imo State in 2020.” The statement continued: “The impassable roads are now paved. We even have dualized highways all round the State. The civil servants and pensioners are being tak­en care of while the health system has been revamped. There is no doubt that things are turning around for good in Imo State. “That is why the body of Christ united under the Chris­tian Association of Nigeria (CAN), most warmly express­es our gratitude to the gover­nor for his relentless efforts to make Imo better.” The Christian body fur­ther noted: “Apart from the huge infrastructure dotting the State’s landscape, we want to appreciate him for his determination to restore and sustain peace in the State. We want to thank him for the empowerment of our youths through SkillUp Imo and other development ini­tiatives.”
