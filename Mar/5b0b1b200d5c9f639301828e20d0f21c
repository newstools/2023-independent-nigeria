President-elect, Bola Ahmed Tinu­bu, has assured that he is commit­ted to rebuilding the country and renewing the “hope of the Nigeri­an people”. Tinubu in a message to Ni­gerians on his 71st birthday on Wednesday, said the greatest birth­day gift he has ever received is the chance to lead the country. The president-elect said his promises were not mere words to win over citizens but a bond with them. “With such a privilege already granted to me, I will not go so far as to suggest I am due any birthday presents this year. I have already been given the greatest gift,” he said. “A chance to lead and fulfill destiny. An opportunity to cham­pion your aspirations and to bring about the Nigeria of your dreams. “I will, instead, use this day as an opportunity to reiterate my commitment to the great and important task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the hope of the Nigerian people. I campaigned hard and made important prom­ises. “Those promises were not mere words; professed glibly or cynically to win support. They rep­resent a bond that binds me to the task of creating a better Nigeria for the benefit of every Nigerian, whether you voted for me or not.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ After the February 25 presi­dential election, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared the former gov­ernor of Lagos as the winner of the election after polling 8,794,726 votes.
