The Lagos State government has said residents of Lagos State would go back to 100% payment of the government-owned buses popularly known as BRT starting from April 1, 2023. The state government has discontinued the 50% slash in prices of bus fares in the state which was a move to cushion the hardship caused by the fuel scarcity and cash crush faced by Nigerians. However, in a recent development, the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA) on Tuesday, disclosed that the slash in prices had come to an end. LAMATA in a public notice posted on their Twitter account said fares of state-owned buses will return to a 100 percent rate on April 1. The notice read, “With effect from Saturday, April 1, bus fare on all regulated buses — BRT, standard, and FLM — shall revert to 100% rate.“Lagos State Governor, Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, had on Wednesday, February 8, 2023, approved a 50% slash in bus fares following the cash crunch brought about by the recent currency swap. “Following the Supreme Court and Federal Government’s pronouncements on the use of old notes alongside the new notes and return of stability to the system, the 50% rebate is hereby discontinued.”
