Former US President Donald Trump will be charged over hush money payments made to a porn star just before the 2016 presidential election. The details of the charges he will face have not yet been released. A grand jury voted to indict him on criminal charges, after investigating a $130,000 pay-out to Stormy Daniels in an attempt to buy her silence over an alleged affair. Mr Trump, the first US president to face charges, denies wrongdoing. (SOURCE: BBC)
