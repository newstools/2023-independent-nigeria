Nigeria’s total public debt stock is N46.25 trillion as of Decem­ber 31, 2022. ($103.11 billion). This is according to a state­ment issued on Thursday by the Debt Management Office (DMO) in Abuja. According to the DMO, the country’s total public debt stock included the domestic and external debts of the Fed­eral Government of Nigeria (FGN) and the sub-national governments. The 36 state governments and the Federal Capital Terri­tory (FCT) are sub-national. For December 31, 2021, the comparative debt stock is N39.59 trillion ($95.77 billion). Total domestic debt stock was N27.55 trillion ($61.42 billion), while total external debt stock was N18.70 trillion ($41.69 bil­lion). “Among the reasons for the increase in total public debt stock were new borrowings by the Federal Government and sub-national govern­ments, primarily to finance budget deficits and execute projects. “The issuance of promisso­ry notes by the Federal Govern­ment to settle some liabilities also contributed to growth in the debt stock,” the office said.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ It, however, said that ongo­ing efforts by the Federal Gov­ernment to increase revenue from oil and non-oil sources through initiatives like the Fi­nance Acts and the Strategic Revenue Mobilisation Initia­tive are expected to support debt sustainability. POLL “Meanwhile, the total debt-to-Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio for December 31, 2022 was 23.20 percent. It indi­cates a slight increase from the figure of December 31, 2021 at 22.47 percent. “The ratio of 23.20 percent is within the 40 percent limit self-imposed by Nigeria and the 55 percent limit recommended by World Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF). “It is also within the 70 per­cent limit recommended by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS),” it said. The total public debt stock as released by DMO excludes the N22 trillion Federal Gov­ernment’s indebtedness to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through Ways and Means ad­vances. The Ways and Means ad­vances are presently awaiting securitisation by the National Assembly, and can only be add­ed to the country’s public debt after such securitization.
