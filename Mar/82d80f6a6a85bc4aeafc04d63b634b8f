Real Madrid has reportedly identified Villarreal defender Juan Foyth as a potential transfer target for the upcoming summer window, according to SPORT. The La Liga club are said to be looking to acquire a new right-back as concerns grow over Dani Carvajal’s form, fitness and longevity. While coach Carlo Ancelotti has Lucas Vazquez and Nacho Fernandez as backups, neither are natural full-backs. Although some reports had linked Chelsea’s Reece James with a move to Real Madrid, the club now appears to have set their sights on Foyth, and have already sounded out his entourage about a possible summer move. However, it must be noted that Barcelona has been pursuing the Argentine international since last summer. Financial Fair Play issues have been a major impediment to Barca’s pursuit of the 25-year-old right-back, and the situation is expected to remain the same this summer as they are currently not in a position to meet Villarreal’s €54million demands for Foyth, which is the value of his release clause. Amidst this, Real Madrid have entered the fray to sign Foyth, who won the FIFA World Cup 2022 with Argentina.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ While the club has sounded out his representatives, they are yet to make a decision on whether they wish to sign him or not. POLL The SPORT report states that Real Madrid has the financial muscle to pull off the deal, but could back out if they feel the asking price is too steep. In addition to Foyth, the reigning Spanish and European champions are also understood to hold an interest in Joao Cancelo, despite having turned down the chance to sign him in January. It remains to be seen whether they go after Foyth or Cancelo, or decide to stay with their current right-back options. The potential signing of Foyth would be a significant addition to Real Madrid’s defensive unit. The player has been in excellent form for Villarreal this season and could provide the necessary cover at right-back, which has been a problem area for the club.
