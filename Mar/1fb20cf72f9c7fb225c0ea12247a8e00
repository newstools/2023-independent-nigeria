LAGOS – The Secretary General of the Maritime Organisation of West and Central Africa (MOWCA), Dr Paul Adalikwu, has sought the support of the Korean government towards establishing a regional shipping line, which will serve the interest of West and Central African countries. Adalikwu made this request in Abidjan during a visit to the Korean Embassy in Côte d’Ivoire. He also highlighted the long standing working relationship between MOWCA and the Korean government through the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA). The MOWCA Secretary General told Lee Jinmoon, First Secretary and Consul, Republic of South Korea Embassy in Abidjan that a regional shipping line will be of collective benefits to the 25 member countries and partner institutions like KOICA. He said such initiative can serve expansion of maritime business opportunities and creation of employment for the thousands of skilled youths who have undergone training within and outside the continent. He highlighted the importance of South Korea as a maritime powerhouse that emphasizes sharing its experience with developing countries and international organisations like MOWCA. In addition to the shipping line, Adalikwu said MOWCA is looking at developing capacity in areas of dry docking- ship repairs and maintenance and local manufacturing of ancillary equipment and working gears like life jackets. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
