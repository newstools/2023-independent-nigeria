LAGOS  –  Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos state has approved a 2023 budget Sector Participation (PSP) operators in the state recapitalize by injecting new waste evacuation trucks into their fleet. This was disclosed by the Managing Director/CEO of the Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), Ibrahim Odumboni , saying that recyclers would also be empowered to procure necessary tools for their projects. Odumboni said that the recapitalisation was aimed at improving waste management in Lagos State, to make the environment cleaner and livable for residents, to cope with about 13,000 metric tonnes of waste generated daily. He explained that the recapitalisation would help to address most of the challenges facing PSP operators, including the high cost of new waste evacuation trucks, which many of the PSP operators could not afford to replace their aging fleet. He said: “The Lagos State Government’s plan is to provide the PSP operators with low-interest loans to purchase new trucks. The government will also provide technical assistance to the PSP operators to help them manage their fleet more efficiently. It will also stimulate economic growth by providing opportunities for small businesses to thrive. By providing the PSP operators with low-interest loans, we are giving them the opportunity to expand their businesses and create more jobs.” ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Odumboni said further that, “In addition to the recapitalisation, the Lagos State Government also plans to empower recyclers in the state.
