The Clerk of the Oyo State House of Assembly, Mrs. Yetunde Awe has condoled with the Speaker of the House, Rt. Honorable Adebo Ogundoyin over the sudden death of his mother, Chief (Mrs.) Justina Iyabo Ogundoyin. The Clerk of the House in a condolence message made available to journalists in Ibadan on Tuesday described the death of Chief (Mrs.) Justina Iyabo Ogundoyin as a rude shock and devastating, most especially at this period when her motherly roles will be more required in the legislative support of the State. Awe through the statement also described the deceased as a loving and caring mother, a strong supporter of democracy and a peaceful woman of honour whose lifestyle is worthy of emulation. She maintained that the death of the late Chief (Mrs.) Ogundoyin has left a vacuum that would be difficult to fill up in many aspects. She however prayed that the Lord grant her soul eternal rest. “I prayed that God should give the family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.” Awe added that late Chief (Mrs.) Ogundoyin will be greatly missed by the immediate family, Eruwa community, Ibarapa land and Oyo State in general.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Until her death, Chief (Mrs.) Justina Ogundoyin was the Iyaloja General of Ibarapa land and the fourth wife of the Ibarapa Business mogul, late Chief Adeseun Ogundoyin.
