 LAGOS. -The Lagos State Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Mr Omotayo Bamgbose-Martins, has reiterated the state government commitment to voluntary compliance with physical planning laws. Bamgbose-Martins said this while speaking with journalists at Alausa,Ikeja. The commissioner said even though the agency would make voluntary compliance with physical planning laws and regulations attractive, it would strengthen the laws to become more punitive to offenders. He urged staff of the ministry to strive to improve the quality of work and shun corrupt tendencies to restore the confidence of Lagos residents in the system. “The truth is that we have to work hard together. We have to do it together,” he said. He said there was need for the ministry personnel to collaborate with the private sector to ensure shared risks and responsibilities to achieve better service delivery.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “We have to be systematic, we will not rush, we will do it stage by stage,” he said. POLL Bamgbose-Martins said the government would audit approvals and punish wrong constructions to serve as deterrent to those who connived to erect structures different from the ones approved. The commissioner also spoke on deployment of technology and public sensitisation “to let people know that we don’t collect bribe; we will not collect bribe but render good service.” “We will get there and together we will succeed,” he told the civil servants. The commissioner recalled the outcomes of town hall meetings done since he assumed office as commissioner in the ministry and his work with consultants towards compilation of issues militating against effective regulation of the built environment in the state. He said an interim report from the consultations on issues of granting of approvals, inspections, certifications, verifications and other actions had been submitted to him.
