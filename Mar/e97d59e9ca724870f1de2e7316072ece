LOKOJA  – Former Chairman of Ijumu Lo­cal Government Council of Kogi State, Fehinti Dada, has warned state Commissioner for Informa­tion and Communication, King­sley Fanwo, against inciting the Senator representing Kogi-West, Smart Adeyemi, against the state Governor, Yahaya Bello. Dada, in a statement made available to newsmen in Lokoja on Wednesday, said that the com­missioner, while reacting to a social media post, allegedly cast aspersions on the personality of the senator. The former council boss said: “My attention has been drawn to a post about the Commissioner of Information and Communi­cation, Kingsley Fanwo, casting aspersions on the personality of the Kogi-West senator.” He wondered what the com­missioner intended to gain from the post that he described as “Eyes service to please his pay master,” pleading with the governor to beware of enemies within trying to feed fat from mischief. According to him, the senator has high regards for the gover­nor and his administration, say­ing he will not make any move to disrespect the integrity of the Kogi-West federal lawmaker. He averred that Fanwo lacks integrity and fear of God as he was one of the first people that called Senator Adeyemi to con­test for the next governorship election. Dada further alleged that he has discreet evidence to prove the conversation of the com­missioner, when Fanwo con­fided in Senator Adeyemi that the people of Kogi-West must be firm as it is clear that Governor Bello is scheming to hand over to another Ebira man to fulfill his 16:16 Agenda as he personal­ly enjoined Senator Adeyemi to run for governorship election.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He advised the governor to be mindful of his enemies within like Fanwo, who lacked the in­tegrity to hold a public office. POLL The former council chair­man added that the course of power-shift being projected by the senator, was in the interest of equity, fairness and justice that Adeyemi stands for. He insisted that the majority of the people of Kogi-West are resolute on producing the next governor of the state irrespec­tive of what an insignificant few may be doing to thwart his efforts.
