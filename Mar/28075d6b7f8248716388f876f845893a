BENIN  – A support group, under the aegis of Greater Edo State (GES), has appealed to the member representing Ovia Federal Constituency in the National Assembly, Dennis Idahosa, to be ready to throw his hat into the 2024 governor­ship race The group noted that Ida­hosa has delivered on his responsibility as a lawmak­er at the national level as a first-timer, adding that he would change the narrative in the state when entrusted with the number-one job of state. The Coordinator of the GES, Emmanuel Asekhame, made the appeal in a release titled: “Entrusting Dennis Ida­hosa With Higher Responsi­bility in Edo State,” and made it available to newsmen in Be­nin on Monday. While noting that they were unaware of the clamour for power-shift to the Central Senatorial District of the state, Asekhame, however, appealed to relevant stake­holders to work towards pre­senting the best for the people irrespective of their ethnicity. The coordinator further posited that there was no­where it was documented that power must rotate from one senatorial district to the other. According to him, “While we don’t want to dwell on the issue of power rotation, we must, however, state that there was nowhere that the issue of power rotation was agreed upon or even documented. We only speak on it on the basis of fairness and equity and nothing more. “As a group, our concern primarily is how to ensure that the people enjoy good gov­ernance and we believe that Idahosa has what it takes to ensure that Edo people enjoy dividends of democracy as evident in his stewardship to the people of Ovia Federal Constituency.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
