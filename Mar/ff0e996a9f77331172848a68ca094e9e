He added: “My state is in a hurry to be a tech hub for the South-West. “I am delighted to appreci­ate the African Development Bank, which has set up a $618 million fund to support the technology and creative sector in Nigeria. This is a great initia­tive spearheaded by Dr. Akin­wunmi Adesina, the Nigerian President of the African Devel­opment Bank, in partnership with our Federal Government and I would like to commend him for his visionary leader­ship and dedication to the de­velopment of our country. “Dr. Adesina has consis­tently demonstrated his com­mitment to supporting the growth and development of African economies, and his efforts towards the develop­ment of the technology and creative sector in Nigeria are commendable. I am con­fident that this fund will go a long way in supporting innovation, job creation, and economic growth in our country”.
