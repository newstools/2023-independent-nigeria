Details are still fairly limited, but two U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters crashed during a routine nighttime training mission over Kentucky, at around 10:00 p.m. local time on Wednesday. Nine soldiers were killed in the crash, according to Lt. Col. Anthony Hoefler, an Army spokesman. Five of those killed were onboard one of the helicopters, four in the other, and there were no survivors, although exactly how the accident unfolded remains unclear at this point. The U.S. Army’s Fort Campbell in Kentucky confirmed the incident to Reuters but the Army initially only confirmed “several casualties.” The location of the incident is reportedly near Highway 68, in Trigg county in the southwest of Kentucky, not far from the Tennessee border, and around 30 miles northwest of Fort Campbell.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ (SOURCE: The Drive)
