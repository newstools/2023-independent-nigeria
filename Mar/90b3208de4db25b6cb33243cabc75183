Osita Okechukwu, Director General of Voice Of Nigeria (VON) and founding member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that the former Aviation Minister and member of the APC Presidential Campaign Council, Femi Fani-kayode joined the ruling party from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and some of his comments especially on ethnic profiling don’t reflect the views of the President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, or the party. Okechukwu while speaking on Arise TV on Tuesday condemned the action of some of his party members who promote ethnic profiling and hate speech. He said, “We have done a lot in infrastructure, agriculture, we paid teachers’ salaries, we cannot be written off. “The only thing is that some of our people don’t know what we have achieved, rather they resorted to primordial sentiments. I cannot support that. Answering questions about the action of Fani-kayode on social media where he spoke about the British envoy, in a derogatory manner, calling him small bald headed, unlettered man, and other inciting and ethnic profiling comments that he engaged in, if they don’t reflect the views of the President–elect, Okechukwu said, “The President-elect that I know from 1998 wouldn’t reflect such views. Did you ask, why the Northern governors of APC wrote a letter to Mr. President on June 4th before the primaries, and said that we would go South in the national interest. “They jettisoned their ambitions to become president. They said that they were going to choose from the South. At the end of the day, it landed on Asiwaju’s table. Why did they vote for Asiwaju? It was because of his compassion. He has assisted people everywhere.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “If you know about my friend Fani-Kayode, he came from PDP. Some of these people transferred to APC. I don’t think that his statements reflect Asiwaju’s position,” he said.
