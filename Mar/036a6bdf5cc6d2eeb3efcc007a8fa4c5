…Says APC narrowly escaped defeat from opposition ABUJA – Chief whip of the Senate and Senator representing Abia North, Orji Uzor Kalu on Tuesday, met with President Muhammadu Buhari, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, where he intimated him of his ambition to become Senate President in the 10th National Assembly. He however revealed that the President didn’t give him an automatic endorsement but exhibited a favourable disposition to his ambition to become the President of the Senate. Kalu also said he would not want to rock the boat if there are vested interest gunning for the leadership of the Senate but would not be averse to accepting the position if it is zoned to the South. Recall that Kalu had jolted Nigerians when he recently declared that it was his turn to become Senate President, shortly after he got re-elected from his constituency. He said he was optimistic that when elected to preside over the Senate, he would work to promote peace among its rank and file. While having an interactive session with State House Correspondents shortly after the meeting with the President, Kalu said there was a need for Buhari to be reintegrated as a Board Trustee member of the All Progressive Congress after his tenure elapses in May 29th this year.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He gave the advice against the backdrop of the performance the party recorded in the recent general elections, which produced former Lagos State Governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu as President-elect, noting that it took the mercy of God for the party to clinch victory at the Presidential polls. POLL The former governor of Abia state also alluded that the APC as a party is sharply divided and it would require the ingenuity of Buhari to reignite the bond within the party.
