Transnational Corporation Plc (Transcorp) has released its financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2022, demonstrating significant improvements in its major in­come lines. The conglomerate with in­vestments in the hospitality, power, and oil & gas sectors recorded growth in its profit before tax, which rose by 8% to N30.3 billion compared to N27.9 billion in December 2021. The conglomerate saw a 7% increase in its power in­vestments, despite the chal­lenges faced in the year from the issues with gas supply, off the diminished oil & gas pro­duction in the country in 2022. The hospitality sector showed a very strong performance, achieving a record revenue of N31.4 billion and profit be­fore tax of N4.5 billion. These achievements have been made within a challenging operating environment characterised by foreign exchange volatility, high cost of production and rising inflation. It’s worth noting that the Group’s total revenue and op­erating profit also experienced significant growth, rising by 21% from N111.2 billion in De­cember 2021 to N134.7 billion in the period under review, and from N38.5 billion in Decem­ber 2021 to N46.7 billion in De­cember 2022, respectively. Op­erating expenses for the year ended December 2022 stood at N23.4 billion, representing an increase of 24% compared to N18.8 billion recorded in the same period of 2021. The results showed that to­tal assets increased by 6% from N416 billion in December 2021 to N442.7 billion in December 2022, primarily due to addition­al investment in the recovery of the power plants and in­vestment in financial assets. Shareholders’ Funds rose to N154.8 billion, representing a 6% year-on-year increase from N146.3 billion recorded in the same period of 2021. Commenting on the results, the President/Group Chief Executive Officer, Dr. (Mrs.) Owen Omogiafo, attributed the success of the results to the robustness of the compa­ny’s business model, which remains prudent and nimble across its operations. She said, “As we reflect on our achievements, we take pride in the improved perfor­mance of our Group. Looking to the future, we will continue to focus on efficiency and cost optimisation, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive to the market while delivering value to our stakeholders.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
