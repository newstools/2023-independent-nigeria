According to NANS, “This decision of the school management is not only Ill-timed but also inconsiderate, unjustifiable, heartless and cruelty of its highest order considering the economic situation of the country. “As a responsive and ideological Students’ body, we wish to state categorically that we won’t fold our arms and let these satanic increments stand. The apex students’ body appealed to the governor and other stakeholders of the university to reverse the unfriendly decision within 72 hours otherwise the body of students would be forced to relocate and occupy the state.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ NANS added, “On this note, the entire students’ Union body in Ekiti State, NANS JCC Ekiti Axis, NANS Zone D, NANS National Body and all well-meaning Nigerian students are hereby notified of our intention to relocate the Secretariat of the National Association of Nigerian Students to Ekiti State University after the expiration of the 72hr ultimatum.”
