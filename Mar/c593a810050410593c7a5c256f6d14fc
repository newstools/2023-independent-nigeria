Marcus Rashford says reports he is looking for a new deal worth £500,000 per week to extend his contract at Manchester United are “complete nonsense”. The England forward will be out of contract in 2024, with the club having triggered a one-year extension earlier this season. Negotiations continue over finalising a long-term deal for Rashford, who has been in fine form since his return from the World Cup, scoring 19 goals in 25 appearances. Rashford, though, has rejected suggestions he is holding out for a big-money pay deal to stay at Old Trafford. “Just before this one starts to do the rounds! It’s complete nonsense,” Rashford wrote on his Instagram story. “The club and myself have been respectful to one another, and that’s how it will remain. My focus is purely on finishing as well as possible in the league and winning trophies.” Rashford was called up for England’s Euro 2024 qualification double-header against Italy and Ukraine, but withdrew having picked up a knock during United’s FA Cup quarter-final win over Fulham.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The 25-year-old, who spent some time in New York during the international break, has returned to training with United ahead of Sunday’s Premier League game at Newcastle.
