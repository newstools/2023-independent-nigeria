AWKA  –  Still basking in the euphoria of Governor Charles Chukwuma Soludo’s performance in his first year in office, the Anambra State chairman of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Sir Nobert Obi, has said the Governor performed beyond expectations, especially in the infrastructural development of the State. In an interview with Daily Independent in Awka, Obi said with “361 kilometres of the road fully awarded and work in progress in virtually all local government areas including my own Ekwusigo” Soludo has demonstrated the zeal to take Anambra to another height. Obi cited an instance with a road: Ozubulu-Ihembosi-Ukpor Road which has been abandoned for 15 years but which Governor Soludo has re-awarded and work in progress. Also, Obi said, the recruitment of 5000 teachers in primary and post-primary schools is another achievement as it was the first of it kind. The chairman said that before now no more than 2000 teachers were recruited in all. Apart from this, he said Soludo will recruit more teachers, especially in specialised subjects. Following this, he continued, the Governor has approved the recruitment of about 3,000 health officers, among them medical doctors, pharmacists,  nurses and so on to reinforce the workforce in the health sector. Obi concluded: ” So, within these 365 days,  he has done a lot; this APGA Governor has done a lot through Prof. Charles Soludo and I know in the next one year it will achieve more”. Obi, however,  advised Soludo to keep on working and not be distracted.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He said: “You know somebody in power, people will like to provoke him, to make him make statements that he will ordinarily not like to make. He should keep on working” Obi concluded
