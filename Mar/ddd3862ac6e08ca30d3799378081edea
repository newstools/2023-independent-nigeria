ABUJA  – KNCV Nigeria is commit­ted to aggressively finding missing cases in Taraba State, being one of the states with the high burden of Tu­berculosis (TB) in Nigeria. It is strategically deploying Active Case Finding (ACF) to systematically screen for active TB, normally outside of health facilities but which could also be undertaken at health facilities in a target­ed population considered at higher risk of developing TB. Senior Program Officer (SPO), KNCV Nigeria, Tara­ba Office, Dr. Timothy C. Bot, who disclosed this in an in­terview with journalists, also hinted they are committed to finding the missing cases in Taraba State. According to him: “We have what we call Active Case Finding (ACF), which is different from passive case finding. The passive one is that you are waiting for the patients to come and meet you (i.e.) when somebody is coughing and he comes to the hospital to tell you that he is coughing and you begin to suspect that it is TB. But when it is active, you are going all out, working in the facilities, working in communities, you are conducting a routine for TB in the contacts of TB patients and we are doing all possible to find missing cases. “Case notification in Tara­ba State has been reporting up to 5,000 cases per annum. It jumped up to that when oth­er NGOs like KNCV came on board, we have tried as much as possible to increase the case notification over the years. Since we started in 2020, we are doing our best and we want to see that we bring more cases to be notified. “One of our intervention areas is routine activities, and public private needs working in the private facili­ties. The other one is we work in the community where we do community Active Case Finding (ACF). We also work with children, trying to find out TB among children. We also do contact tracing to see if their relations have TB. We are trying to do everything we can to find missing cases.”
