UMUAHIA – It was an occasion of joy and thanksgiving to God last Sun­day for the family of Okoli in Obiagu-Lekwesi in Umunneochi Local Government Area of Abia State when the House of Repre­sentatives-elect for Isuikwuato/ Umunneochi Federal Constitu­ency, Chief Amobi Ogah, pledged to henceforth pay the sum of N100,000 as monthly allowance to a spinal cord injury son, Oscar Okoli. At the occasion, the mother of the young man living with spinal cord injury had to shed tears of joy for the benevolence of the philanthropist/politician as her son, the patient Oscar Oko­li, leaped for joy.

However, when the news of Oscar’s worsening health condi­tion was broken to Ogah in Feb­ruary this year, he visited the ail­ing young man and donated the sum of N50, 000 for his upkeep Then on Sunday, he attended a church at the Methodist Church Lekwesi and used the opportu­nity to announce the monthly al­lowance of N100, 000 to the spinal cord injury patient to the delight of the congregation, as well as l joy and happiness of his mother.
