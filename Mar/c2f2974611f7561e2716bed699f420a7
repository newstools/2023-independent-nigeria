Chieftain of the All Progres­sives Congress (APC), Cap­tain Sunday Adebomi (rtd), has commended Ekiti State Governor, Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji, for involving criti­cal party stakeholders in the appointment process of his administration. Adebomi, former gover­norship aspirant, particularly hailed the governor’s novel ini­tiative in setting up a political appointments committee where serving and former party lead­ers were involved. He also hailed the governor’s broad approach to governance by mainstreaming youths. Adebomi, former chairman, Ekiti State Emergency Manage­ment Committee (SEMA), said Oyebanji has demonstrated the capacity to take Ekiti to the next levels with his robust interven­tions in the area of welfare of workers and infrastructural development across the 16 local government areas of the state. “Let me use this opportunity to commend the governor’s peo­ple- approach to governance by setting up the first ever political appointments committee. The governor did not only set up the committee but he ensured that eminent party leaders and youths were involved in the process to emplace an inclusive cabinet. “For the first time in the his­tory of our dear state, we are having a governor who truly be­lieves in the development of the state by combining competence with humility. Since assuming office, Oyebanji has endured prompt payment of salaries and outstanding arrears.” He, therefore, urged Ekiti people to continue to support Oyebanji’s administration in order to enjoy more dividends of democracy in the state.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
