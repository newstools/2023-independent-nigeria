Manchester United have reportedly ‘expressed an interest’ in Borussia Dortmund star Gregor Kobel as they try to persuade David de Gea to sign a new contract at the club. Erik ten Hag is thought to want to sign a new goalkeeper in the summer whether the club keeps De Gea or not, with Dean Henderson set to leave the club on a permanent basis. And according to Blick, the Red Devils have ‘expressed an interest’ in Kobel, who’s also thought to be on Chelsea’s radar, while Tottenham are ‘thinking’ of the 25-year-old as they seek a replacement for Hugo Lloris. Kobel has only been at Dortmund for 18 months but has established himself as one of the standout stoppers in the Bundesliga. Dortmund want to extend Kobel’s contract, which currently runs until the summer of 2026, but the Swiss international is thought to want to treble his current salary, which stands at around £35,000 per week. That would be a comfortable wage for United, with De Gea currently earning a whopping £375,000 per week. The Blick report claims that if Kobel does seek a move the Bundesliga side will want between €40m (£35.2m) and €50m (£44m) for his services.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The news comes after The Athletic reported that De Gea has rebuffed United’s first official extension offer. POLL The Spaniard has deemed the offer ‘unsatisfactory’, though it’s claimed all parties are keen on finding a solution and are confident a suitable deal will be thrashed out. De Gea recently revealed that he is keen to stay at Old Trafford and isn’t concerned about his contract. “Yeah, I’m very relaxed. [I] Just focus on training, perform as best as I can. But, for sure, it’s going to end in a good way. “I was saying this is my club. I’ve been here many, many years and it’s a huge honour to be here and I’m so happy here.” De Gea has dominated the No.1 spot since arriving in 2011 and has won more club player of the year awards than any other United player in that time.
