MFS Africa, one of the largest digital payments networks in Africa, oper­ating in over 35 African countries, has partnered with Access Bank, Nige­ria’s largest bank which operates across 17 mar­kets, to expand Acces­sAfrica remittance cor­ridors. AccessAfrica is Access Bank’s service that allows customers to conveniently transfer and receive mon­ey across the world from loved ones and business partners. The partnership will provide simplified trans­fers for AccessAfrica cus­tomers, enabling real-time, cost-effective cross-border payments for individuals and businesses who want to send financial support to their families abroad or fa­cilitate trade transactions. AccessAfrica customers will also be able to receive payments from all over the world through MFS Africa partners. Robert Giles, Senior Banking Advisor, Retail, Access Bank, while com­menting on the partner­ship with MFS Africa, said: “This partnership builds on the existing cross-bor­der payment infrastruc­ture by Access Bank and would facilitate payments to more African corridors, increasing the number of countries we can send in­stant payments through Access Africa to. “Our partnership with MFS Africa and access to hundreds of millions of peo­ple in the new markets will help our customers pay and be paid, facilitating greater economic inclusion through trade as well as helping fam­ilies across borders. “Critically this propels us closer towards being ‘Af­rica’s gateway to the world’ and democratizing access to payments through af­fordable, safe and reliable platforms.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “The partnership re­affirms MFS Africa’s commitment to making borders matter less for individuals and organisa­tions across the continent, ultimately fostering finan­cial inclusion. Through this partnership we’ll be expanding Access instant outbound remittance reach to potentially 400 million mobile wallets and more than 130 banks across over 40 African countries, enabling thousands of people and businesses throughout the continent to receive payments in real time from Nigeria, and im­proving convenience for and facilitating trade with the neighbouring countries and beyond.
