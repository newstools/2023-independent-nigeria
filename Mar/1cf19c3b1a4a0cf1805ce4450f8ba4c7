ABUJA – The Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) on Thursday, commended Nnenna Nnannaya-Oti, the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) for Abia State in the just concluded 2023 governorship election, over her “impressive performance”. IPAC in a statement signed by its national chairman, Yabagi Sani, said the Council is pleased with Oti’s “ability to rise above pressure and deliver on your statutory mandate without fear or favour”. The body of registered political parties in Nigeria, in the letter dated 24th March, also expressed hope that “others can emulate this virtue of integrity”, which it said “is lacking among some public officers put in position of trust”. It also vowed to continue to “stand against antidemocratic forces in whatever form or guise”. It further commended people who it maintained are adding value to the country’s”nascent democracy”.
