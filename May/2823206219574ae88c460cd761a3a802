AC Milan have reached an ‘agreement’ with Leicester City defender Daniel Amartey over the player joining them on a free transfer in the summer, according to reports in Italy. The Ghanaian international is just one of two of City’s title winners who remains in the squad, alongside Jamie Vardy. He was the only addition in the 2016 January transfer window, just a few months before lifting the trophy with City. Amartey is one of a few players out of contract in the summer, and looks likely to leave the club at the end of the season. He has fallen down the pecking order under interim manager Dean Smith, with the re-emergence of Caglar Soyuncu meaning he is yet to make an appearance under the new boss. According to Italian outlet IlRomanista , AC Milan have ‘identified’ Amartey as a target, with the City man ‘closer’ to joining the Italian giants. The report even goes on to say that an ‘agreement’ has been found. Despite it appearing close, the report adds that Inter Milan are also showing an interest in the player ahead of the window. Both teams are keen to add to their defensive numbers in the summer. Amartey won’t be the only defender who looks likely to leave in the summer. Latest reports claim that Soyuncu, who is also out of contract at the end of the season, has agreed to join Atletico Madrid for next season. Amartey had been ahead of Soyuncu in the pecking order under Brendan Rodgers this season. He’s made a total of 24 appearances in all competitions this season, but has started just three of the last 14 Premier League games. He has been an unused substitute in all four games under Smith. The 28-year-old played the full 90 minutes of all three of Ghana’s group stage games at the World Cup at the end of last year.
