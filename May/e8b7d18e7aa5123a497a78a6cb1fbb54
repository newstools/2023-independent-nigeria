BIRNIN KEBBI – The dreaded bandit kingpin, Dogo Gide, on Thursday, released two remaining girls in his captiv­ity. The Chairman of the Parents Committee, Muhammad Salim, via text message said that the sto­ry circulating about the release of the final batch of two girls is true. He wrote in reply to an inquiry sent to him by our correspondent, “The information you heard is true but we are still cruising,” he said. His younger sister, Farida, and one other girl were the ones released today still journeying to the town to meet anxious waiting, and grieving parents. Two weeks ago, through con­certed efforts by the parent’s committee who raised funds for an undisclosed Ransome through appeals to well-meaning Nigeri­ans sales of their belongings secured the release of four girls among other batches earlier re­leased by bandits. Recall that armed bandits about two years ago attacked and kidnapped no fewer than 91 students of Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, in Kebbi State by Dogo Gide faction of ban­dits. Since then parents of the ab­ducted were thrown into mourn­ing as some were rumoured to have been married by bandits while others were allegedly sold into slavery but fortunately, all of them have returned, though some with pregnancies.
