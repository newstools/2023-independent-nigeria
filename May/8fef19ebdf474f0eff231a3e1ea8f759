ASABA  – Delta State Chapter of the So­cial Democratic Party, SDP) Wednesday dumped its guber­natorial candidate for the 2023 election, Olorogun Kenneth Gbagi, saying it is not part of the case instituted against the State Governor-elect, Rt Hon Sheriff Oborevwori at the elec­tion petition tribunal. State party Chairman, Mr. Oke Idawene disclosed this when he led other executive members and stakeholders of the party in the State to pay a congratulatory visit to the State Governor-elect, Rt Hon Sheriff Oborevwori in Asaba, he maintained that the party is not in line with the desire of their guber candidate to take the Governor-elect and his party to court over the results of the Governorship elections conducted in the state in March 2023. According to Idawene, “Our reason for coming here this afternoon is not an acci­dent. You will recall that about three years ago, I had a dream and told you that I am the next Governor of Delta State. “Today, the dream has come to pass. Now, we looked at it, I cannot have that dream and somebody will come to truncate it. We in agreement, in unison, applied officially to the tribunal that we are not part of any litigation against your (Rt Hon Sheriff Oborev­wori) emergence. “This visit is calculated to tell the world that we did not do it in hiding, we did it to say that before SDP, there is a Delta State and that you are the Gov­ernor-elect and in a few days, you will be the Governor of Delta and not PDP. The entire Exco here is saying that every­thing we would need to do to en­sure that Sheriff Oborevwori succeeds in Delta, we will do it. “We are also aware of some bombardment from Abuja and I said we are Deltans, we are doing what Delta stands for and not party affairs and as we leave here, some of us will be in the tribunal as agents of the party to justify that the man (Olorogun Ken­neth Gbagi) was never ready for elections, he didn’t pay any agents and that we have re­jected his body, soul and spirit.
