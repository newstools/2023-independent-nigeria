Nigeria’s Flying Eagles have qualified for the round of 16 of the ongoing FIFA U20 World Cup in Argentina. The Flying Eagles defeated Italy 2-0 in a Group D top-of-the-table clash on Wednesday night. Salim Fago Lawal’s diving header and Jude Sunday’s last-gasp finish earned Nigeria victory over Italy in an end-to-end encounter at the Estadio Malvinas, Argentina. The result left the Flying Eagles and the Azzurri on six and three points respectively after two games apiece in Group D.
