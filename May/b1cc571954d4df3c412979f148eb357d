ABUJA  – Vice President Kashim Shettima has revealed that $10 billion was spent by the immediate past ad­ministration of President Muhammadu Buhari sub­sidising fuel in 2022. He said the current ad­ministration was bent on exiting fuel subsidy be­cause of its negative im­plications for the country as a whole. Shettima reiterated his principal’s position on Tuesday, while reporting for duties on his first day in office at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He said the current ad­ministration anticipated that there will be fierce op­position to its decision to remove fuel subsidy. “The president has al­ready made pronounce­ments yesterday on the issue of the fuel subsidy. The truth of the matter is that it is either we get rid of the subsidy or the fuel subsidy gets rid of the Ni­gerian nation. “In 2022, we spent $10 billion subsidising the ostentatious lifestyle of the upper class of society because you and I benefit 90% from the oil subsidy. The poor 40% of Nigeri­ans benefit very little and we know the consequenc­es of unveiling a masquer­ade. “We will get fierce op­position from those bene­fiting from the oil subsidy scam but where there is a will, there is a way. Be rest assured that our president is a man of strong will and conviction. “In the fullness of time, you will appreciate his noble intentions for the nation. The issue of fuel subsidy will be frontally addressed. The earlier we do so, the better.’’
