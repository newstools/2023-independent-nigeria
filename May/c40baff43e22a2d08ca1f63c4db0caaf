Gunmen have reportedly beheaded an officer of the Nigerian Police Force in Abia State. The victim, simply identified as Linus, was reportedly killed along East Street, Ndiegoro, Aba, Abia State. It was gathered that Linus and his colleagues were at Tenant Road along East Street on Tuesday at about 5:00 a.m. when the assailants engaged them in gunfire. On sighting the hoodlums, other police officers on the team allegedly fled the scene while Linus (a.k.a Agbalagba), an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), was attacked. According to Vanguard, the criminals cut off the ASP’s head and made away with his gun and service uniform. A resident who pleaded anonymity reportedly told journalists that the gruesome killing on Tuesday had caused tension among residents of East Street, Ngwa Road, Akpu Road, Ndoki Street, Etche Road, and Ulasi Road, all within the Ndiegoro axis as the criminals were said to have threatened to attack more policemen and residents. “With what we heard, they said they have declared war on police and the residents. I don’t know what happened, but the way they killed the policeman, with his head removed and what we heard they were shouting during the attack, shows that there’s a problem in Aba,” the resident reportedly said.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
