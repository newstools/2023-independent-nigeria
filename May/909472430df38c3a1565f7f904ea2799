BENIN  – Former Minority Whip, of the House of Representatives, Dr. Samson Osagie, has urged mem­bers of the 10th National Assem­bly to utilise their oversight func­tions to ensure treaties that are of immense benefits to Nigeria are immediately domesticated. He said treaties like the Af­rican Continental Free Trade Agreement; Double Taxation Agreements with several coun­tries, etc, should be immediately domesticated by the 10th Nation­al Assembly so that Nigeria can begin to derive their (treaties) benefits for economic develop­ment. The former Edo lawmaker who was one of the resource persons at a 5-day induction programme organised by the National Assembly in collabora­tion with the National Institute of Legislative and Democratic Studies, for newly elected mem­bers of the 10th Assembly, said though issues of foreign policy formulation are within the do­main of executive arm of gov­ernment, Section 12 of the 1999 Constitution empowers the Na­tional Assembly to enact laws to incorporate Treaties already en­tered into by Nigeria before such Treaties can become enforceable in Nigeria The five-day induction pro­gramme themed: ‘Foreign Policy and Domestication of Treaties: The Role of the National Assem­bly.’ Dr. Osagie is also the Chair­man of the African Bar Associa­tion and an Adjunct Lecturer at the National Institute of Legis­lative and Democratic Studies, Abuja, argued that it is of no use for Nigeria to sign an agreement it does not intend to honour.
