Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State has been honoured with the prestigious Commander of the Order of the Niger (CON,) award by the Federal Govern­ment of Nigeria. President Muhammadu Bu­hari approved the different cat­egories of the Special National Honours Award 2023 on Sunday. Governor Uzodimma’s came less than 12 hours after the gov­ernment of Rivers State found him worthy for her highest Hon­our of Grand Service Star of Riv­ers State (GSSRS). Imo people are already excit­ed over the harvest of awards, which they say, were both fitting and deserving of a hardworking governor. The state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, said the recognition by the Federal Government sign­posts the immense contributions of the governor to national devel­opment and unity. He also said it was a vindica­tion of Uzodimma’s tireless com­mitment to national cohesion and patriotic zeal in the discharge of his duties. Emelumba said Imo people were particularly appreciative of President Buhari’s love for the governor and the state, noting Senator Uzodimma will continue to be at the vanguard for nation­al cohesion and growth both as a public officer and patriotic Ni­gerian. Also, Chairman of the Board of Benjamin Uwajimogu Col­lege of the Ihitte Uboma, Eze Oliver Ohanwe, said Governor Uzodimma deserves any honour done him by the Federal Govern­ment, state, groups or individuals because “he has proven to have capacity for national, state and individuals development.”
