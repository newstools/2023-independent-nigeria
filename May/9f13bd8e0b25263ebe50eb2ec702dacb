Jurgen Klopp says “miracles” are out of his side’s hands this time as Liverpool prepare to visit Leicester on Monday in a huge game at both ends of the table. Fifth-placed Liverpool are four points behind Newcastle and Manchester United with three games left in the race to qualify for the Champions League. Leicester are two points adrift from Premier League safety at the bottom. “I knew weeks ago it was completely out of sight,” Klopp said of his side’s top-four chances. “I couldn’t see it at all, but that did not mean we would not try to get closer. That’s the only thing we did, we got closer.” Liverpool and the Champions League invoke special memories for Klopp, with his side having overturned a 3-0 first-leg deficit to beat Barcelona in the semi-finals on their way to winning the tournament in 2019. “Everyone involved will never forget it in our entire lives,” he said.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ In 2021, Klopp’s side also won eight games and drew two in the final 10 matches, including a 90th-minute winner by goalkeeper Alisson, to finish in the top four. POLL “That means it is part of us and, you are right, we were around when miracles happened, that is true, but it was then still in our hands,” said Klopp. “Now we have to win but that does not mean anything changes because the other teams could win all their games.”
