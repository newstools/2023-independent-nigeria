The family of Ayelabola of Ile Ife has urged the Governor of Osun State, Ademola Adeleke to copy from his Ogun State counterpart, Dapo Abiodun who had last year signed into law a bill titled ‘Oba, Chiefs, Council of Obas and Traditional Council Law of Ogun State Bill 2021’. The family according to a statement released and signed by Chief Michael Ayelabola on behalf of the family said their son who had been on the run after he was declared wanted by some of the Oro cult group after the death of the previous Ooni of Ife is yet to regain freedom. “The bill that was signed into law on Monday, January 10, 2022, by Gov. Abiodun is aimed at respecting human dignity and promoting modernity in the installation and burial of traditional rulers. It is also expected to curb fetish practices in the process of installing and burying traditional rulers in the state”, the statement reads in part. The statement added: “We are pleading with our legislators in the Osun State House of Assembly and our amiable Governor, Demola Adeleke to replicate such bill in Osun State in order to stem the ritualistic and oppressive activities of the Ogboni Cults in Obaship institutions in Osun State and Yorubaland”. “Our son who was involved in the Abobaku saga is still being chased by the Oro Cult group up till now hence we are pleading with the government to save the soul of our son. We learned there was a similar situation in Ondo State after the demise of the King in Ile-Oluji, as Oro cults are still on the trail of the nominated Abobaku there”, said Chief Ayelabola. Adding that, Governor Abiodun has done so well to bring back sanity and justification into the chieftaincy institution in Ogun State by introducing the Traditional Council Reform Law, urging the Osun State Government to do the same.
