Only a year after signing, Fabio Vieira could be on his way out of Arsenal – if reports from The Athletic are to be believed. Journalist Amy Lawrence has suggested a list of Arsenal players who could be sold this summer, Fabio Vieira being one of them. As Mikel Arteta plans a summer rebuild, it doesn’t seem tangible to sell a 22-year-old, just one year after signing him. However, when managing a club the size of Arsenal, you have to be cruel to be kind. Vieira hasn’t shown significant progress since signing and is not at the heights he was set when he first signed.
