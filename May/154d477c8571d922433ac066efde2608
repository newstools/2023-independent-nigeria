LAGOS  – Hero Lager, a product of International Breweries Plc, a proud part of the world’s largest brewer, AB InBev, has launched the People’s Hero Initiative to support musical artists on their journey to relevance. The People’s Hero Initiative, an offshoot of Hero Lager’s “Uru Dia Campaign”, seeks to recognise and reward the worth within the brand’s consumers and is expected to give the fast-rising artistes the much-needed platform, funding, and mentoring to navigate the daunting journey to acceptance and recognition in the music industry. Bamise Oyegbami, Marketing Director, International Breweries Plc, made this known at the launch event held in Lagos on Friday, May 5, 2023.

But Hero Lager is doing something different; the brand, through the People’s Hero Initiative, is standing firmly behind creatives who are still on their journey to earning the acknowledgment and recognition they deserve,” Oyegbami said. The initiative which aims to foster the development of ecosystem artists can leverage to receive support in the form of funding, airplay, and distribution of their work, as well as mentorship from established music acts is expected to support more creatives in the near future.
