The Adéwálé Students’ Confer­ence is set to reward academic excellence with N5,000,000.00 in cash prizes in the 2023 edition of its annual inter-school competi­tion. The team, which announced the cash prize during a tour of various secondary schools, asked the participating schools to get their best candidates ready for the students’ conference, which includes the inter-school quiz, keynote addresses and other ac­tivities. The Adéwálé Students’ Con­ference kicked off the 2023 edition with an exciting tour to a few se­lected schools and zonal educa­tion offices across different towns in Ogun, covering 11 schools within seven local government areas in Sagamu, Abeokuta, and Sango. The tour tagged: “Adéwálé Goes to School” is aimed to en­gage secondary school students, especially science students, the core of their learning comfort, relaying the vision and mission of the initiative while celebrating academic excellence. It was indeed an avalanche of memorable moments as the con­vener, Michael Adesanya, and his team impacted and inspired the students through recreation­al games and knowledge-driven activities. In his speech, Micheal Ade­sanya cited his life experiences as a call to action to motivate the stu­dents, recounting examples from his time in secondary school, as documented in his debut memoir Adéwálé, My Mother’s Son. He encouraged them to keep up the excellent work in their ac­ademics and assured them that being book smart is a talent that is both rewarding and enriching, and in addition to the students’ gifts from the Adéwálé team. Adewale’s publisher, Tweak­Centric Solutions, donated com­plimentary copies of his memoir to the school libraries. POLL During the tour, the Adéwálé team met with past participants and ambassadors from previous editions as the team was glad to hear that the students main­tained their excellent stride, even after the competition.
