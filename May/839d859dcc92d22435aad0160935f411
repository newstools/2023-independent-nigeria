ABUJA  – Ebonyi State governor, David Umahi, has argued that given the support the President-elect, Bola Tinubu of the All Progres­sives Congress (APC) received from the South-East, leading to his success at the polls, the region should be compensated with the position of the Senate President. He went on to insist that he was the most experienced to be­come the President of the Senate in the tenth Assembly, despite be­ing elected into the Senate for the first time. This was even as the governor said he came to invite Mr. Pres­ident to commission the newly constructed airport named after Muhammadu Buhari in the state. He made these remarks in an interview with State House cor­respondents, on Tuesday, after he paid a visit to President Muham­madu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Governor Umahi, who is a senator-elect for Ebonyi South Senatorial District, also argued that the South-Eastern region deserves the position of the President of the Nigerian Senate, which is the third highest politi­cal office in the country. The governor further noted that zoning the position to the South-East is the right thing to do, depicting equity and justice. “I think that every region clamouring for the presidency of the Senate to be zoned to it is the right of such people. If you look at the true reflection of our society, you will agree with me that the right thing to be done by our leaders without prejudice to their rights and thinking is that the South-East deserves the num­ber three position.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
