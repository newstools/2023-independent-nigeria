Declares It Null And Void ABUJA – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Monday dismissed the purported suspension of the former Governor of Kaduna State and former Acting National Chairman of our Party, Senator Ahmed Mohammed Makarfi, reportedly by the Ward Executive of Tudun Wada Ward of Makarfi Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The National Working Committee (NWC) of the party, in a statement by the spokesman of the party, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, said after a thorough consideration of all the issues raised by the Ward Executive, hereby declares the purported decision and action of the Tudun Wada Ward Executives which borders on issues of discipline, as null and void and of no effect, not being consistent with the provisions of the Constitution of the PDP (As amended in 2017). Section 57 (7) of the party Constitution provides that “notwithstanding any other provision relating to discipline, no Executive Committee, at any level except the National Executive Committee, shall entertain any question of discipline as may relate or concern a member of the National Executive Committee, Deputy Governor or member of the National Assembly.” The party NWC said it cited that provision of the PDP Constitution for clarity’s sake. “The NWC, therefore, charges all leaders, critical stakeholders, members, teeming supporters of our Party in Kaduna State and the general public to disregard the purported suspension of Senator Makarfi by the Ward being a member of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of our Party,” the party said. The PDP NWC also charged all party members in Kaduna State to remain united at this critical time especially as the party leadership is progressing in “our concerted effort to ensure a comprehensive reconciliation in our Party.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
