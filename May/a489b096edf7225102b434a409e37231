The Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde has been named the Vice Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF). He emerged by consensus at a closed-door meeting of the governors held in Abuja on Tuesday night. Also, the Kwara State Governor now succeeds the outgoing Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, who has been acting as the Chairman of NGF since last year. This was contained in a statement signed this morning by Gov Tambuwal. Immediate past Governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi, was the substantive Chairman of the NGF until his second term in office as governor ended last year. Tambuwal, who was Fayemi’s deputy was named as the acting Chairman of the Forum. The NGF is an umbrella body for all 36 state governors in the country. Reacting to the new fear, Governor Makinde said, “Honoured to be the new Vice Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum. I look forward to working with the new Chairman, His Excellency AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, the forum secretariat staff and all members of the forum as we strive for inclusive development at the subnational level and effective collaborations at the national level. POLL “Let me use this opportunity to thank my brother Governors for their vote of confidence and support.”
