The Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo, Thursday, was hon­oured with an Award for Exem­plary Leadership in Maritime Security at the International Symposium on Blue Ocean Economy and Maritime Secu­rity in Africa: Challenges and Prospects for Agenda 2063 held in Stellenbosch, South Africa. Vice Admiral Gambo was bestowed with the award by Prof M.S. Tshehla, Dean of the Faculty of Military Science, Stellenbosch University while Mr Patrick Agbambu, CEO of Security Watch Africa Initiatives read his ci­tation. The symposium was based on the premise that the suc­cessful attainment of the African Union’s Agenda 2063 objec­tives is premised on sustainable peace and security on the continent. Thus, it requires coordinat­ed efforts on all fronts across the continent. Most of the programmes and associated outcomes of the continent’s de­velopmental agenda are linked to its ocean waters. By symposium thus sought to explore various aspects of the Blue Ocean Economy and the potential roles that the na­vies of various countries can play, in conjunction with public and private sector entities, in ensuring security on the con­tinent’s ocean waters.
