Tottenham are among the clubs that have been offered the chance to sign Roma star Paulo Dybala this summer. The Argentina World Cup winner has a bargain release clause in his Roma contract that becomes active ahead of next season and could tempt a number of Premier League sides to make a move for the 29-year-old attacker. Chelsea, Arsenal and Newcastle have also been offered the opportunity of bringing Dybala to the Premier League after a stellar season under Jose Mourinho at Roma. The Argentina international has scored 16 goals and provided a further eight assists in just 34 appearances across all competitions this term. Harry Kane’s future at Spurs remains uncertain as he enters the final year of his current deal at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The England international has been heavily linked with a move to Manchester United, with Erik ten Hag looking to sign a world-class No. 9 after allowing Cristiano Ronaldo to leave Old Trafford prior to the World Cup. Dybala’s contract contains a handful of release clauses – €20million (£17.5million) for fellow Serie A clubs and just €12million (£10.5million) for overseas clubs. A report from 90min states that the Argentine’s representatives have been making sure clubs in the Premier League are aware. None of the English sides are yet to turn the offer down, but there are long-standing concerns that Dybala is not interested in a move to the Premier League and any efforts to sign him would ultimately prove futile. Even if a club decides to activate his release clause, the decision will lie with the player, who may want to remain in Italy. Should Kane leave this summer, Dybala has the quality to replicate some key parts of the England captain’s game in terms of his playmaking ability and goalscoring record.
