KANO – Northern Nigerian Youths for Abbas(NNYA) on Thursday said that the emergence of Tajudeen Abbas as the next speaker of House of Representative would change the complexity of National Assembly politics in the 10th Assembly. A statementon jointly signed by NNYA coordinator and Public Relation Officer (PRO) Haliru Ibrahim and Abdullazeez Alhassan respectively, enjoined members-elect across divides to aggregate their support and queue behind Abbas leadership. NNYA in the statement explained that the Nigerian-styled democracy needs to strike a balance between legislative activism and achieving results in the overall interest of a largely under-developed populace and economy,hence the need to give the leadership mandate to Hon.Abbas The group stated that the NNYA stands on the platform of merit, service, patriotic zeal, transparency and loyalty to the Nigerian project which are vital ingredients to unshackle our people from the twin evil of poverty and ignorance. The statement stressed that “we are emboldened to set a clear agenda for the leadership that we wish for Nigerians, which must be built on transparency, accountability, trust, intelligence and above all youthfulness.” It added “We can not talk about the leadership of the most important arm of the National Assembly, which aggregates the totality of our diversities as a people, without talking about getting a leadership that will prioritize the needs of the long suffering and marginalized people of Nigeria.” Without a shadow of doubt, we do believe that the mandate of representing all Nigerians through the House of Representatives should rest on the shoulders of Tajudeen Abbas. The statement in parts read “Having contributed immensely to the growth of the democratic process with the sponsorship of 73 bills in the 9th Assembly alone, combining it another 43 bills to his credit in the 8th Assembly. POLL “We believe that the task of building bridges will be carried out effortlessly under the leadership of Hon Abbas. We reason that it would cost us more as a nation if we keep sacrificing our best brains on the altar of primordial sentiments such as zoning or religion.”
