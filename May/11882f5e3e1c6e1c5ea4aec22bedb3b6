KATSINA – Malam Dikko Umar Radda, the Governor of Katsina State has pledged to operate a single treasury account to strengthen accountability and block all loop­holes in its finances in the state. Radda made this pledge during his inaugural address shortly after being sworn in at the Muhammad Dikko Stadium in Katsina on Monday. He said leakages in payrolls, overheads and capital projects would be targeted until his admin­istration can eradicate and ensure that public finances are managed efficiently. The Governor also maintained that his administration will con­duct a comprehensive staff audit to eliminate ghost workers and ensure that public servants serve the government judiciously. “We will encourage public ser­vants to come forward as whis­tleblowers whenever they observe practices that violate due process and the rule of law”, he said. Radda further revealed that the government will try to bring a new approach to governance, “It will be inclusive and diverse, focusing on solid policy implementation and delivery”. “The policy blueprint devel­oped will be a dynamic document that will be consistently revised in line with strategic priorities and the capacity of the state”. On the insecurity issue, Radda said it would be paramount, as his administration will deploy all available resources to end bandit­ry and criminality across the state. POLL He added that the government will also engage communities in the fight to ensure that security is sustained, assuring those affected that his administration would do its best to build their lives and fo­cus on their wellbeing.
