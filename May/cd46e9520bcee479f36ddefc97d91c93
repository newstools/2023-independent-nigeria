LAGOS  – The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, NNPCL, has stated that its formal resumption of oil and gas exploration in the Chad basin would open more opportunities to monetise the nation’s abundant hydrocarbon resources, by Expanding Access to Energy to support economic growth, industrialisation, and job creation in Nigeria Wadi-B Prospect (OPL 732), Chad Basin, is located at Tuba Community, Jere Local Government Area of Borno, 50km away from Maiduguri. The Seismic Acquisition of the project started in 1995, while its oil discovery search was announced in 2015 but suspended due to insurgency, according to the NNPCL Speaking recently, the Group Chief Executive Officer, GCEO, of the NNPCL, Mele Kyari, said the re-mobilisation of a drilling rig to the Chad Basin for the first time since the 1980s efforts indeed underscored the visionary leadership of Mr President. He said Wadi-B well was considered an Appraisal/Exploration well as it had been designed to appraise seven hydrocarbon reservoir depth levels encountered by the Wadi-1 well that was drilled in 1985 and to explore deeper hydrocarbon reservoir targets up to a total depth of four Kilometres. He expressed readiness to carry out detailed exploration of the Frontier Sedimentary Basins using the best industry standards and technologies, with the aim of attaining commercial discoveries of crude oil and gas. “As a commercial enterprise, NNPCL sees this project as an opportunity to monetise our abundant hydrocarbon resources, by Expanding Access to Energy to support economic growth, industrialisation, and job creation across the country. “Our renewed drilling campaign has a higher geological chance of making commercial discoveries of hydrocarbons as we are equipped with state-of-the-art integrated geophysical datasets. POLL “Therefore, this is a spud-in event that will reinforce the government’s commitment for exploration in the Nation’s Frontier Basins, primarily aimed at increasing the nation’s hydrocarbon reserves,” Kyari said. Kyari commended the governor of Borno for achieving this historic milestone, adding that the Wadi-B Well has a lot of prospects including projected total depth of 14,000 feet, using the ACME Energy Services rig with the capacity of 2000 horse power plus.
