Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, has stated that Africa must focus on reducing Trade Barriers, regional supply chains, economic diversification and focus on youth-led job creation to make the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). Georgieva, while speaking on IMF’s Paper that talks about the potential for the AfCFTA, stated that the paper will focus on the minds of policymakers to unleash development, adding that the 3 points that African policymakers need to focus on are: “Reduction of trade barriers, if Africa decides to follow the ASEAN example, and bring trade barriers from 6% down to 1% that would be a major step in the direction; she said Africa needs to remove tariff barriers and non-tariff trade barriers. “Use trade as an engine for integration in global supply chains and make regional supply chains vibrant. “Diversify the economy, when countries trade more, they deepen specialization that boosts productivity. A vibrant youthful population for jobs, as trade is a massive generator for jobs, if we are to get 800 million jobs necessary over the next decade; we need trade to be the engine of job development”. She also noted that since 2018, countries of the continent have embraced AFCFTA, adding that 54 out of 55 have signed, and 44 have ratified already. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “But of course, legislating is only the beginning, what matters is what policies are put in place so the continent can capture the advantage of trade which are enormous for Africa. POLL “What has been a disadvantage, more barriers to trade, limited intra continental trade can be turned around and be an opportunity, if the AfCFTA is implemented, trade barriers removed, long trade barriers removed and logistics transportation improved, intra continental can grow by 53% She added that trade outside of the continent can grow by 15%, and that translates into tremendous benefits in terms of an increase in income, which is a 10% increase in income as a result.
