Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has disclosed that the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt, under its Food Security Plan, has shown interest in the Agro Processing Zone located in the Gate­way International Agro Cargo Airport, along Ipe­ru-Ilishan Remo Road in the state. According to the gover­nor, the North African na­tion had signified interest to have farm its plantations in the zone, plant crops, process the produce and also export the proceeds back to the home country. Abiodun, who added that the representatives of the Egyptian government would be coming to Ogun very soon and finalise the details of their investment, disclosed this during an in­teractive session with the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Ogun State chapter, in Abeokuta, at the weekend. He said: “Last week, I met with the national Pres­ident of the Rice Farmers Association in Abuja. It is a good opportunity for me to inform you that he is working with a team of Egyptian farmers from the Egyptian government who have the policy of food se­curity and they identified Ogun State as one of the states they will like to part­ner with. “So on the 16th of this month, the representatives of the Egyptian govern­ment in agriculture will be coming to Ogun State. “Their interest is the Agro Processing Zone; they want to have farm planta­tion there, they want to plant, they want to process and they want to export back to Egypt under their Food Security Plan. “They have done their research and were con­vinced that Ogun State is one of the states that is strategically located for them to invest in, to farm, to process and to export,” Governor Abiodun stated.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ While noting that his administration was poised to encourage foreign and local agric investors to partake in the out-grower scheme where land would no longer be allocated to them, but to local farm­ers and other interested parties in the state, he de­clared, “it is the belief of this administration that the idea would further help to empower farmers in the state.”
