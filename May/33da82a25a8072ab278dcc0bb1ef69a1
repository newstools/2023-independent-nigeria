The Senate on Tuesday passed for second reading a bill seeking to establish an institution known as the National Centre for Christian Education. Sponsored by Senator Binos Yaroe (Adamawa South), the Bill seeks to “regulate and set standards” acceptable to the practice of Christianity in the country. In his presentation, the Sponsor noted that the “inappropriate practice” of religions in the country has caused problems in the past. On his part, Senator Istifanus Gyang, (Plateau North) lamented the wrong application of religion which he said breeds extremism. “We don’t have to suspect ourselves across religious divides. Rather, we need to understand, and respect ourselves, our peculiarity and reality,” Gyang said. “Religion as wrongly practiced is what has bred extremism and hate but rightly practiced, religion can be a source of strength and national cohesion. “This is where the place of a commission that will develop a curriculum for Christian education is very necessary.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Benue South lawmaker, Senator Abba Moro, said the bill is “apt” owing to the fact that some youths have been manipulated by extremist religious leaders. POLL “There is no gainsaying that part of the problem we have in some parts of the country is the inappropriate explanation of the Bible and the Quran,” the senator said. The bill scaled second reading after it was put to a voice vote by Senate President Ahmad Lawan. Lawan referred the bill to the Committee on education for further legislative input.
