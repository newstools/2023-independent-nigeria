BENIN – Members of the incoming 10th Assembly have been enjoined to be fully conscious of the fact that Nigerians would watch their performances in order to deliver a verdict in four years’ time. Dr. Samson Osagie, a former Minority Whip of the House of Representatives gave the admonition in his goodwill message at an event titled ‘Most Valuable Parliamentarian Hall of Fame.’ Most Valuable Parliamentarian Hall of Fame is an event organized by Order Paper to honour and reward performing lawmakers (National Assembly) based on the metric of data in terms of bills sponsored and in character. The ex-lawmaker who described the event as “a novel and catalytic contribution towards improved service delivery by members of the National Assembly,” urged incoming Lawmakers to work hard so they too could be enlisted in the Hall of Fame. He said: “I enjoin the incoming 10th Assembly to be fully conscious of and be swayed by the fact of this novel initiative and that Nigerians would watch their performances in order to deliver a verdict in four years’ time. “ Osagie noted that the Most Valuable Parliamentarian Hall of Fame would significantly contribute to legislative strengthening and promoting the independence and people-centered legislature. He urged organizers of the programme to see that “this initiative is sustained for the enlightenment of citizens in the country about the role and undeniable impact of parliament, healthy competition among members of parliament to take the mandate of their constituents very seriously, especially in the core area of lawmaking and for the development of democracy in Nigeria.”
