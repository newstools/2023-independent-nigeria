PORT HARCOURT – President-elect, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu has described the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike as a man of character and integrity who stood his grounds in the countdown to the 2023 general elections that power must return to the southern part of Nigeria. Tinubu who is in Rivers on a two-day visit to commission some key projects thanked Wike for his contributions to his emergence as the President-elect, saying that he couldn’t have been victorious at the poll without the structural contribution of Wike.

It is on the strength of your character that I stand here to fulfill the promise I made during my campaigns.” On the refund of money used to prosecute federal projects in Rivers State, a demand made by Governor Wike, Tinubu said he owed the Governor nothing. “I owe you nothing on the demands made on the 12th flyover. Is your (project) own. You live here. You have to lobby me to collect,” Tinubu said.
