Leaders of Nembe Kingdom in Bayelsa State have condemned what they describe as the indiscriminate felling of mangroves (called angala in Ijaw) in their environment. They made their position known in a communique issued after the Nembe Divisional Council of Chiefs’ meeting held at the Egweama town hall. It was signed by the divisional council of chiefs’ chairman, secretary and public relations officer, Senator Nimi Barigha-Amange, Theo Kimoerigha-Onu and Nengi James, respectively. They expressed concern that the ill-advised depletion of mangroves had caused considerable ecological damage to their environment. The council made up of all registered War Canoe Chiefs also frowned at the incessant picking of periwinkles, saying that God endowed the Nembe-speaking people with the sea food “for sustenance and well-being.” They regretted that the periwinkles were being bagged and shipped out daily, and warned those involved in the illicit deal to desist forthwith. The chiefs’ council also strongly condemned the use of offensive and provocative words “in this highly politicized times”, urging the people of the area to rededicate themselves to preserve unity rather than harbouring deep-seated anger against one another. They further stressed the need for all people of Nembe extraction to work for the protection of unity and sovereignty of Nembe-Se, irrespective of whatever differences that may exist. POLL The chiefs’ council called on the people to embrace peace and shun violence in the interest and progress of Nembe Kingdom.
