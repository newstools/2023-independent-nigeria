LAGOS  – The Chairman of the Board of Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAHCO) Plc, Dr. Seinde Fadeni, has charged the Federal Government to as a matter of urgency released the trapped funds of foreign airlines in the in vaults of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The crisis of the trapped funds had been lingering in the country in the past 18 months. As at the end of April 2023, the total trapped funds of the foreign airlines had increased to $802 million, while the carriers have reacted by blocking the lower inventories for travelling agencies, selling tickets at high rates, reducing frequencies into Nigeria or suspending operations into the country. Fadeni, who made the call at the 42nd Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the company in Lagos, regretted the situation, saying that those who had worked hard for their money should be allowed access to it. He said: “The Federal Government should speedily resolve the issue of funds belonging to the airlines. It is just fair that monies legitimately earned should be released to the operators who earn such funds. “NAHCO stands with the airlines and calls on the Federal Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria to release these funds. This would give the government more credibility as well as increase foreign investors’ confidence in our nation.” Fadeni pointed out that government should be an enabler, providing the needed environment for legitimate businesses to thrive. He, however, expressed the optimism that the incoming administration would improve the nation’s economy. POLL “NAHCO shares in this hope as also expressed by majority of local and international businesses. We are poised to take advantage of business – enhancing policies of the in-coming administration, he said,”
