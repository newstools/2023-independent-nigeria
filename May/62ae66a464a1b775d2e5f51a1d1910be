Archbishop Daniel Okoh, President, Christian Associ­ation of Nigeria (CAN), has raised concerns over the re­cent resurgence of killings of citizens in Mangu and Riyom Local Government Areas of Plateau State. He said this in a statement made available to newsmen on Monday in Abuja saying, “The killings which started in Mangu villages on Monday, 15th May 2023, by so-called un­known gunmen have claimed many lives and properties with many persons still miss­ing. The villages affected in­clude Fungzai, Hale, Kubwat, Bwoi and many other com­munities of Kombun District of Mangu Local Government Area and some communities in Riyom Local Government Area. According to reports, about 130 people were killed, about 1000 buildings were burnt, and about 22 villages were affected. “We condemn these bar­baric acts in the strongest terms possible. It is disheart­ening to see innocent citizens being killed and their proper­ties destroyed in such a grue­some manner”. He continued: “While we appreciate the efforts of the security forces to maintain peace, we call on the govern­ment and law enforcement agencies to bring the perpe­trators of these heinous acts to justice and to ensure the protection of lives and prop­erties of all citizens.
