A suspected land grabber, popu­larly known as Mojeed Solabi, has invaded Adumbu Community in Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun State with over 50 thugs, injuring two and beating up vil­lage head to pulp. Solabi was said to have invaded the town with thugs armed with dangerous weapons including cutlasses, broken bottles, axes, chasing people away from their homes and ancestral lands in the community. Resident of the community in a “Save Our Letter” dated January 27, 2023, to the state police entitled, “Case of Conspiracy Threat To Life and Invasion of Adumbu Vil­lage By Land Grabbers: Mojeed Solabi, Abdullahi Solabi,” jointly signed by an Elder in the village, Dr. Dele Onatade, and the Secre­tary, Chief Ranti Falola, asked the police to come to their rescue. They alleged that Solabi and his cohorts through the backing of one Mutairu Owoeye, have been terrorizing and threatening the peace of the community since February 2013 when they invaded the village and sacked the entire community including the late Vil­lage Head, Chief Olalekan Ogunjo­bi over 4000 hectares of land The residents said that Solabi was declared wanted by the police that year but ran away and resur­faced this year to start his land grabbing activities by first trying to take over the possession of sev­en acres of land meant for building of a primary school for the com­munity and later claiming the possession of other people’s lands. Efforts by the Village Head of the Community, Chief Kayode Fa­lola, to restore peace were thwart­ed by Solabi when he allegedly led his thugs to the Village Head block industry, beat him to a stu­por and arrested him with some policemen allegedly from Zone 2, Headquarters, Onikan, Lagos. Falola said that Salabi also went with his thugs to attack the secretary of the village, Chief Ranti Falola, at his house, man­handled him and tore his clothes before they dragged him into the same police vehicle, they put him in and drove both of them off to their station in Zone 2, Onikan, Lagos.  ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
