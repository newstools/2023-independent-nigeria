ABUJA  – The House of Representatives on Tuesday urged the Cen­tral Criminal Court, UK, and the government of the UK to temper justice with mercy in sentencing Senator Ike Ekwer­emadu and wife, Beatrice. The House also urged the Federal Government of Nige­ria to take all diplomatic steps and other necessary interven­tions regarding the travails of the Ekweremadu’s family. The resolutions of the House followed the adoption of an urgent motion of public importance brought by Hon. Toby Okechukwu. In moving the motion, the lawmaker noted that Senator Ike Ekweremadu, a Nigerian citizen, serving senator of the Federal Republic of Ni­geria, former Deputy Presi­dent of the Nigerian Senate, and former Deputy Speaker and Speaker of the ECOW­AS Parliament and his wife, Mrs. Beatrice, were tried and convicted by the Central Criminal Court, London, the United Kingdom (UK) for of­fences relating to the breach of the novel Modern Slavery Act 2015. Hon. Okechukwu said that the sentencing of the couple is scheduled for May 5, 2023. He said that Senator Ike Ekweremadu acted within his limited knowledge of the UK laws and did write to the UK High Commission to support the medical visa ap­plication for an organ donor and did declare the purpose of the trip. Cognisant of the fact that Senator Ekweremadu and Mrs. Beatrice acted under the natu­ral instincts of parents to save an ailing daughter, and not for commercial purposes.
