Sky Sports Italia claims Roma have fully agreed a deal to sign Lyon talent Houssem Aouar on a free transfer this summer. The Algerian midfielder emerged as one of the most exciting youngsters in Europe when he broke into the Lyon first team back in 2017 and has grown into an interesting but inconsistent player in Ligue 1. Injuries have disrupted Aouar’s season, limiting him to just 484 minutes of action across 14 Ligue 1 appearances this campaign. Last season, the 24-year-old scored six goals and provided four assists in 36 league games. Sky Sports Italia suggests that Roma have now fully agreed a deal with Aouar, ready to welcome him on a free transfer after his contract expires with Lyon in the summer. Last month, Calciomercato.com and TMW reported that the 24-year-old Algerian midfielder had carried out his medicals with the Giallorossi. In the past, he’s been linked with moves to Arsenal and Manchester United.
