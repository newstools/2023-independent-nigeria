Speaking on behalf of the protesters Mr. James Allu, said the coalition is aware of the government’s plan to induce the justices send to deliver judgement in the tribunal in the state. According to James Allu,” We are calling on the justices to stay away from all government facilities and patronage to avoid external influence In the dispensation of justice without fear or favour. “We are already aware of how the government has been working tirelessly to ensure they influence the judges using some of the retired justices,” he said. The spoke person also alleged that there were several attempts to duplicate the INEC-certified results which were legally given to the PDP by the Nasarawa State INEC REC and some staff, and the attempt to tamper with the Irev portal to ensure that the tribunal gets confused in the dispensation of justice. Mr. James Allu also said that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He explained that the coalition desire to have a society of equity and not oppression; added that it is about their communities living like every other people living in their ancestral land.
