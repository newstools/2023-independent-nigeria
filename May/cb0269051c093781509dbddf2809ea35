Atletico Madrid have a history of taken veteran Barcelona stars and making good use of them, and they could be looking to repeat the trick again this summer. According to Ferran Martinez, Los Colchoneros are considering a move for Barcelona’s Jordi Alba. The left-back has a €38m salary coming his way this summer due to deferred wages, and as such, Barcelona are looking to move him on or at least reduce his wages. Atletico may be willing to offer him an exit, or even include him in a deal for Yannick Carrasco.
