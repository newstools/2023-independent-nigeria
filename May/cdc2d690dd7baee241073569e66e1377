LAGOS  – The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) at the weekend said there are no plan by the bank to phase out the redesigned naira notes. In a statement by the bank’s Acting Director, Cor­porate Communications, Dr. Isa AbdulMumim said, “The attention of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has been drawn to a piece of fake news recirculating in the me­dia, particularly in the social media space, suggesting that the bank is contemplating the withdrawal of the recently redesigned N1000, N500 and N200 currency banknotes from circulation. “We wish to state emphat­ically that such speculation is unfounded and a ploy by some interests to cause panic among members of the pub­lic”. He then reiterated that the new and old currency notes have been circulating side by side just as the bank has been taking delivery of a good quantity of the rede­signed bank notes from the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Company (NSP­MC) Limited. “Furthermore, we are com­mitted to supplying the ap­proved indent for the smooth running of the economy. We, therefore, urge members of the public to disregard any report suggesting a phase-out of the redesigned currency. “For the avoidance of doubt, the redesigned and old notes will continue to be accepted as legal tender. They will circulate side-by-side for transactions ahead of Decem­ber 31, 2023 deadline, when the old N1000, N500 and N200 banknotes will eventually be phased out”, AbdulMumim said.
