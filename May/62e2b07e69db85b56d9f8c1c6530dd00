LAGOS  – The member-elect for Ethiope Federal Constituency in the 10th National Assembly and Chairman of the Appropriation and Finance Committee in the Delta State House of Assembly, Erhiatake Ibori- Suenu, has thrown her weight behind the aspiration of Tajudeen Abbas, for the House of Representa­tives, saying that his legislative experience stands him out the next Speaker. Ibori- Suenu disclosed this to selected journalists at the week­end when Abass and members of his Joint Task team visited the Lagos State Governor, Ba­bajide Sanwo-Olu, in the state House, Marina, during their maiden consultative engage­ment to seek bipartisan support of the governor. On why she backs Abbass’ candidature as next Speaker of the House of Representatives of the 10th Assembly, Ibori-Suenu said: “First, the main reason why I support his candidature is be­cause we need the 10th Assembly that has a very good relationship with the Executive. We need the 10 Assembly that will work har­moniously with the Executive because if that relationship is strained, members will actually have a tough time.
