LAGOS  – Airbus, the airplanes manufacturing company delivered 127 commercial aircraft in the first quarter (Q1) of 2023. This was contained in the Airbus consolidated financial results for the Q1 ending March 31, 2023. Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer (CEO) said that the quarter confirmed strong demand for its products, particularly for commercial aircraft. Faury also said that the quarter benefited from a good performance in helicopters despite the adverse operating environment that includes in particular persistent tensions in the supply chain, which confront the airlines and other companies across the world. He insisted that its 2023 guidance was unchanged with commercial aircraft deliveries expected to be backloaded. “We remain focused on delivering the commercial aircraft ramp-up and longer-term transformation,” he said. Gross commercial aircraft orders totalled 156 (Q1 2022: 253 aircraft), with net orders of 142 aircraft after cancellations (Q1 2022: 83 aircraft). The order backlog amounted to 7,254 commercial aircraft at the end of March 2023. POLL Airbus Helicopters registered 39 net orders (Q1 2022: 56 units), which were well spread across programmes. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value was €2.5 billion (Q1 2022: € 3.2 billion). Consolidated revenues decreased slightly to €11.8 billion (Q1 2022: €12.0 billion). A total of 127 commercial aircraft were delivered, comprising 10 A220s, 106 A320 Family, 6 A330s and 5 A350s. Revenues generated by Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities decreased five percent year-on-year, mainly reflecting the lower deliveries, partly offset by the strengthening of the US dollar. Airbus Helicopters deliveries increased to 71 units (Q1 2022: 39 units), mainly driven by the Light helicopter segment. The division’s revenues rose 26 per cent, mainly reflecting deliveries and a solid performance across programmes, favourable mix effects as well as a good start to the year in services. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space decreased 6 per cent, mainly driven by lower volume in Military Air Systems and in Space Systems. One A400M transport aircraft was delivered in Q1 2023. Consolidated Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) adjusted – an alternative performance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – decreased to €773 million (Q1 2022: €1,263 million). EBIT adjusted related to Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities decreased to €580 million (Q1 2022: € 1,065 million). The decrease reflects the lower deliveries, a slightly less favourable hedge rate compared to Q1 2022 and investments for preparing the future. Q1 2022 included the positive impact from retirement obligations partly offset by the impact resulting from international sanctions against Russia.
