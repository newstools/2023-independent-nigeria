LAGOS – Chief Magistrate Adeola Olatunbosun of a Lagos State Chief Magistrates’ Court, on Wednesday, directed that popular Afrobe­at singer, Seun Kuti, should further be remanded for four days in the custody of the police. Seun Kuti is alleged to have assaulted a police officer on the Third Mainland Bridge, Lagos. The Chief Magistrate gave the order following a motion ex-parte brought by the police asking for an order of the court to remand the defendant in police custody for four days at the State Criminal Investi­gation Department (SCID), Yaba, Lagos, to enable it to carry out further investigation. The prosecution team, led by Simon Lough (SAN), told the court that the mo­tion ex-parte is supported by a 12-para­graph affidavit with one exhibit attached to it. The SAN equally informed Chief Magistrate Olatunbosun that the motion ex-perte is supported with addresses, even as he added that the 12-paragraph affidavit was deposed to by ACP Saheed Kassim; one of the Investigating Police Officer (IPO) attached to the SCID. According to Lough (SAN), the motion is brought under Sections 264(1), (2), (3), (4) & (6) & 257 of Administration of Crimi­nal Justice Law of Lagos State, 2021 (As Amended), Sections 4 & 10 of the Police Act, 2020 and sections 6(6), 35(1)(C), (5) & (7)(9) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (As Amended). Lough (SAN) said, “It is our humble submission that from the facts, nature, and circumstance of this case, the applicant is entitled to the relief sought from this court in the interest of justice, public order, and morality.”
