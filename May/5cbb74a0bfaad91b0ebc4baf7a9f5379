Jose Mourinho is showing he is the master of European club competitions. Just a year after leading AS Roma to UEFA Europa Conference League, Mourinho has the Italian club in the finals of the UEFA Europa League. Roma punched their UEL finals ticket after a second-leg goalless draw against Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen on Thursday night. The first leg went to Roma, who got a 1-0 win at their Olimpico. Standing in Mourinho’s way for consecutive seasons with European trophies is Sevilla. The Spanish club got a 3-2 win on aggregate against Juventus in the second semifinals matchup and hopes that the Europa League title can salvage their 2022-23 season. Sevilla is only 10th on the domestic La Liga standings. The UEL final match is scheduled for 31 May and will be played at Puskás Aréna in Budapest, Hungary. AS Roma will return to the Europa League final match for the first time since 1990–91 when the competition was called UEFA Cup. They lost to Inter Milan in the two-game finals back then. Sevilla, on the other hand, has become a specialist in Europa League. They won the tournament for the first time in 2006 and, since then, lifted the Europa League trophy five more times. Their most recent win came in 2020 when they beat Inter Milan 3-2 at RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne, Germany.
