Afenifere, the pan Yoruba so­cio-political organisation, has expressed the hope that the inau­guration of a new government in Nigeria under the leadership of Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu on May 29, 2023, would herald a new lease of life in the country. The affirmation was con­tained in a statement issued by the National Publicity Secretary of the organisation, Comrade Jare Ajayi on Sunday. According to the pan Yoruba organisation, the president-elect, Ahmed Bola Tinubu, by his an­tecedents, has what it takes to take Nigeria to a greater height. “We are confident that he will assemble a goal-getting team that will enable him to translate his dreams for new and better Nige­ria into reality. “These dreams include calming the fray nerves among various sections of the country, restoring security and safety of lives and properties, shore up the economy, revamp our collapsed educational system, overhaul the dilapidated infrastructure, create jobs and restore the dashed hopes of youths in the country, setting Nigeria on the path of industrial­ization and bringing her into the comity of most advanced coun­tries in the world in social, eco­nomic and political terms within the shortest time possible.” The spokesman then sub­mitted that for the above to be achieved, the new president needs to consider some key areas which deserve urgent and critical attention. These areas are insecurity, economy, rekindling a sense of unity and patriotism among Ni­gerians, revamping agriculture, power, health and infrastructure
