KANO – Elder statesman, Tanko Yakasai OFR on Friday said the latest debates on Tinubu’s victory at the last presidential election are a mere academic exercise that would not alter the equation. Yakasai in a statement made available to newsmen in Kano explained that Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s victory rested on the constitutional provision that a winner is declared by the majority of required votes. The elder statesman said “I believe whoever got the 25% in 29 states has received more than what the constitution required from him. Any other debate is a mere academic exercise” He stressed, “In my view, it is about what is required for a presidential or gubernatorial candidate to satisfy in getting elected. The simple answer is the majority of the required votes”. The elder statesman noted that “The current debate about the 25% votes a presidential candidate on 2/3% of the total number of stateis still ongoing unabated. This is mainly because of different legal interpretations which is normal with lawyers”. Tanko Yakasai admitted that the issue at hand may have attracted conflicting interpretation by lawyers, he however said that “Lawyers often don’t agree with one another and therefore the nore debate. “ He stated that for Lawyers “to arrive at the realistic conclusion of the argument, we should go back to the request made by the politicians to the lawyers and the motive behind the request.” Yakasai explained that “In the instant case the issue to consider is the reason behind the need behind and the motive why the politicians are asking for the question.”
