The chairperson of Na­tional Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Professor Mojisola Christianah Adeyeye, has hinted that the im­plicated Indomie Instant Noodles ‘Special Chicken Flavour’ is not registered by NAFDAC for sale in Nigeria. She noted that it was import­ant to mention that noodles are on the Import Prohibition List of the Federal Government of Nigeria and is therefore not permitted for importation to Nigeria. Adeyeye gave this hint in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja, while adding that the Indomie instant noodles products (and other brands of noodles) registered by NAFDAC for sale in the Nigerian market are manufactured in Nigeria and are only granted NAFDAC registra­tion status following a strict regu­latory regime covering all aspects of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). She said the Ports Inspec­tion Directorate (PID) is also on heightened alert to guard against importation of the implicated product into Nigeria. NAFDAC re-assure the public that the Agency is proactive and remains alive to her responsibili­ties of safeguarding the health of the public. The statement reads: “The management of National Agency for Food and Drug Administra­tion and Control is aware of the re­calls of Indomie Instant Noodles ‘Special Chicken Flavour’ by the Ministries of Health in Malaysia and Taiwan on account of the al­leged presence of ethylene oxide, a compound associated with an increased risk of cancer. “NAFDAC, as a responsible and responsive regulator, is taking swift actions to carry out random sampling and analysis of Indom­ie noodles (including the season­ing) for the presence of ethylene oxide, as well as extending the investigation to other brands of instant noodles offered for sale to Nigerians. “We use this medium to assure the public that thorough investi­gation of the products will be conducted both at the factory and market levels and our findings will be communicated.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
