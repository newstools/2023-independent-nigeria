Julius Aghahowa, the former Super Eagles forward has drawn comparisons on his time in the national team and now with a conclusion that the present Super Eagles players are technically sound but are bereft of fighting spirit. The former star, while in a chat with select journalists on the sideline of an event in Lagos recently, admitted the enormous talent in the three times African champions but said they lack the fighting spirit to effectively compete. Aghahowa said: “There is no doubt that the present Super Eagles players are technically sound; the talent is there but there is still something lacking in the team, which is that fighting spirit that we don’t have. “This is because most of these players are coming from Europe or they went there when they were very young. So they don’t have that fighting spirit which we had or may be some of us who were born and we grew up here have. “If you talk about talent, they are talented but sincerely that fighting spirit is not there,” he said. He averred that there should be a mixture of domestic and foreign-based footballers in the national team in order to bring the right balance and competition, saying such would be to the benefit of the team. Aghahowa features for Nigeria in four African Cup of Nations and one World Cup in South Korea and Japan where he headed Nigeria into the lead in their opener against Sweden.
