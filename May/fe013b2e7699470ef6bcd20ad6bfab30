LAGOS  – The Lagos State Government said it will divert traffic at the Ogolonto Junction in Ikorodu for one week over the ongoing rehabilitation of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Corridor from the area to Stadium at Surul­ere. A statement by Dr. Frederic Oladeinde, the Commissioner for Transportation, Lagos State, said that the traffic di­version would enable seamless repairs of the failed section of the road. Oladeinde, however, allayed the fears of the citizenry, say­ing that traffic inbound Ma­jidun and beyond from Oba Sekumade would be diverted to Agric to make a U-turn to ac­cess their desired destinations. He also said that traffic in­bound Oba Sekumade from Agric would be diverted to Majidun to make a U-turn and continue their journeys. Besides, he reaffirmed that the rehabilitation works would be carried out at night to min­imise inconveniences for mo­torists, while traffic personnel would be deployed to ensure seamless movement. He appealed to motorists to cooperate with the interven­tion put in place by the govern­ment to manage the expected traffic surge effectively.
