The Governor-elect of Abia, Alex Otti has urged his supporters not to be worried about the recent Federal High Court ruling in Kano that invalidated his candidacy. The court had ruled that the process leading to the selection of Otti and other candidates of the party was not in line with the requirements laid out in the 2022 electoral act. Otti who spoke with Vanguard in Abia, said arrangements for his swearing-in on May 29 were on full gear as planned, declaring that the antics of the enemies of democracy cannot truncate the will of Abians. According to him, the decision of the court would have no significance in the coming inauguration of the governor-elect. Igara added that only the election tribunal is bequeathed the power to sack a democratically elected person. He said, “That court pronouncement is laughable. Everybody should go about their normal activities. It is only the tribunal that can remove Alex Otti. “It is not just a court that will remove someone who was duly elected. In fact, I am going to gear up activities for the inauguration”
