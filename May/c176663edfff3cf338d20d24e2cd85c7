The U.S. Justice Department announced on Tuesday the arrest of 288 suspects, as part of an international law enforcement operation aimed at curbing the illicit trafficking of fentanyl and other dangerous opioids on the dark web. The operation, dubbed Operation SpecTor, involved multiple law enforcement agencies and was conducted across the United States, Europe and South America. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the sweep led to the seizure of 117 firearms, 850 kilograms of drugs and US$53.4 million in cash and virtual currencies. (SOURCE: Global News)
