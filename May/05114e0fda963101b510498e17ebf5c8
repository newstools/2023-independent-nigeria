SIAKA MOMOH The Manufacturing Association of Nigeria (MAN) has stated in very clear terms, how manufacturing fared in Nigeria in the second half of year 2022 in MAN Bi-Annual Review Second Half 2022 recently released. This document presents the summary of findings of the survey of manufacturing sector by the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) for the second half of 2022. The survey is designed to monitor changes in manufacturing sector performance indicators via-a-via the behaviours of macroeconomic and policy environments during the period of the survey. The focus of manufacturing indicators include capacity utilization, production value, inventory, level of utilization of local raw materials, investment, expenditure on alternative energy source, etc. The details are as follow: Manufacturing Capacity Utilization In the second half of 2022, year-on-year, Capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector declined to 54.9 percent from 59 percent recorded in the corresponding half of 2021; thus, indicated 4.1 percentage points decline over the period. Quarter-on-quarter, it declined by 3 percentage points when compared with 57.9 percent recorded in the first half of the year. Manufacturing capacity utilization averaged 56.4 percent in 2022 as against 55.9 percent average of 2021. The decline in manufacturing capacity utilization in the period is due to the adverse effect of high cost of energy and the Russian Ukrainian war, the grave effects of the Naira Redesigning policy and other perennial challenges such as acute shortage of Forex for importation of raw materials and machines, high cost of borrowing and many more. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Manufacturing Production Value POLL Manufacturing sector factory output value declined to N2.68 trillion in the second half of 2022 from N3.73 trillion recorded in the corresponding half of 2021; thus, indicating N1.05 trillion or 28 percent declined over the period. It also declined N1.31 trillion or 32 percent when compared with N3.99 trillion recorded in the preceding half. The value of manufacturing production totaled N6.67 trillion in 2022 as against N7.39 trillion recorded in 2021. Manufacturing production was severely affected in the second half of 2022 by absence of implementation of new capital project by the government as they focused on the election. Production in the sector was also negatively affected by limited purchases by households due to the Naira redesign policy, the high inflationary pressure in the country, high cost of energy, particularly diesel and gas, acute shortage of forex for importation of raw materials and machinery needs of the sector that are not locally manufactured in the time being and many more. Unfortunately, the issues of the basic metal group whereby duty of Annealed Cold roll was reduced to 5 percent from the previous 45 percent; the suspension of motorcycles in some areas across States, the increase in the duty of paper from 5 percent to 20 percent and so on are still effective. These challenges, in addition to the perennial issues, contribute enormously to the dip in the production of the sector in the period under review. Local Raw-Materials Sourcing Manufacturing sector local raw materials sourcing increased to 53.5 percent in the second half of 2022 from 50 per cent recorded in the corresponding half of 2022; thus, indicating 3.5 percentage points increase over the period. It also increased by 1.5 percentage points when compared with 52 percent recorded in the preceding half. Local raw materials utilization in the sector averaged 52.8 percent in 2022 as against 51.5 percent recorded in 2021. The increase in the local raw materials utilization in the sector during the period is due to increased difficulty in sourcing forex which compelled manufacturers to look more inward for raw materials notwithstanding the associated huge cost. It is therefore important for the Government to re-evaluate its role in local development and production of raw materials in terms of funding. For instance, the development and production of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) has continuously eluded due to limited funding of the Raw Materials Research and Development Council (RMRDC) by the Government. The absence of local production of APIs has been having dire consequences on the pharmaceutical the current situation of acute shortage of forex. tical production, particularly in Unsold Inventory of Finished Products Inventory of unsold finished products in the manufacturing sector increased to N282.56 billion in the second half of 2022 up from N169.75 billion recorded in the corresponding half of 2021; thus, indicating N112.81 billion or 66 percent increase over the period. It also increased by N85.46 billion or 51 percent when compared with N187.1 billion recorded in the first half of the year. Inventory of unsold goods in the sector totaled N469.66 billion in 2022 as against N384.58 billion recorded in 2021. The high inventory recorded in the period is attributed to low purchasing power in the economy due to declining real income of household following the continuous increase in inflationary pressures in the country. This is worsened by the Naira Redesign policy which began in the last quarter of 2022. The withdrawal of large amount of the ‘old Naira’ without commensurate replacement with the ‘new notes’ resulted to cash crunch in the economy with very limited means of purchasing items by households across the country. Manufacturing Investments: Manufacturing sector investment dipped to N145.59 billion in the second half of 2022 down from N160.88 billion recorded in the corresponding half of 2021; thus, indicating N15.29 billion or 10 percent decline over the period. It further declined by N32.8 billion or 18 percent when compared with N178.39 billion recorded in the first half of the year. Manufacturing investment totaled N323.98 billion in 2022 as against N305.02 billion recorded in 2021. Investment in the period was affected by the high debt profile of the Government which particularly deters foreign investment, high cost of borrowing, high cost of energy, low consumption during the period and many more. Manufacturing Employment: Based on MAN survey since 2013, cumulative manufacturing employment was estimated at 1,686,725 at the end of 2022. However, in the second half of 2022, manufacturing employment dipped to 6741 down from 8508 and 9559 recorded in the corresponding half of 2021 and the first half of 2022 respectively. The decline in the number of jobs created in the sector during the period corroborates the poor operating business environment that was perverse with high energy cost, exorbitant cost of borrowing, high inflation, low sales due to limited cash and many more. Electricity Supply to Industries: Electricity supply to the industries from the national grid declined marginally to 11 hours per day from 12 hours recorded in the preceding half. However, average number of outages per day stabilized at 4 times in the second half of 2022 as it was recorded for the first half of the year. Irrefutably, the trends shows that power supply to the industry is still a huge challenge which accounts for huge investment of manufacturers in self-energy generation. Consequently, expenditure of alternative energy source increased to N76.7 billion in the second half of 2022 from N45.04 billion recorded in the corresponding half of 2021; thus, indicating N31.66 billion or 70 percent increase over the period. It also increased by N8.9 billion or 13 percent when compared with N67.8 billion recorded in the preceding half. The expenditure was incurred on procurement of diesel, gas, generators and spare parts, inverters and UPS, etc. Cost of Funds to Manufacturers In the second half of 2022, average lending rate to the sector from the commercial banks slowed to 22 percent from 24 percent recorded in the corresponding half of 2021 and the first half of 2022 respectively. The trend shows a 2 percentage points declined over the periods. Commercial bank lending rate to the industries is grossly influenced by the incessant increase in Monetary Policy rate in quest to maintain an appreciable real interest in order to attract foreign investment inflow. In the last quarter of 2022, Monetary Policy Rate was retained at 16.5 percent; CRR was 32.5 percent; and Liquidity Ratio, 30 percent.
