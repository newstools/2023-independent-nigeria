ABUJA  – Operatives of the Nigeria Police Force – National Cybercrime Centre (NPF-NCCC) in partner­ships with the South Australian Police have arrested and recov­ered 60,000 AUD from an alleged serial fraudster, Ogenevowero Emefeke. The 37 year-old Emefeke, a resident of Guida Area of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), was successfully apprehended for pulling-off an elaborate fraudu­lent scheme on an Australian National. The Force Spokesperson, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said, this is coming on the heels of actionable intelligence made available by the South Australian Police De­partment (SAPOL). He said, “The suspect, in a written statement during a Po­lice interview, freely admitted to having committed the fraud and several others dating back to 2021. In unmasking his modus operandi, investigation reveals that the suspect and his cohorts usually adopt pseudo identities of renowned International ce­lebrities, carefully select their victims through different social media platforms, lure them into an attack popularly known as “Romance Scam”, and after gaining their trust, subsequent­ly play on their emotion to swin­dle them of their resources. The Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, while applauding the new wave of anti-cybercrime achievements recorded by NPF-NCCC under the constructive leadership of the Director National Cyber­crime Centre, DCP Ifeanyi Hen­ry Uche, via collaborations with international anti-cybercrime agencies, charged the centre to sustain the drive. In the same vein, the IGP urges members of the Public to exercise restraint in engaging in businesses and relationships with individuals whose real iden­tities have not been physically verified. While the processes to repa­triate the recovered fund to the victim through the Australian Consulate is being perfected, the suspect will be charged to court upon the conclusion of investiga­tions, it was gathered.
