The Human Rights Writ­ers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has commend­ed the House of Represen­tatives for its clarification on the alleged bill, which seeks to criminalise pro­tests by the citizenry. HURIWA also applauded the Federal High Court Abu­ja Division for halting the rapid advancement towards dictatorship by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC). HURIWA in a statement by Comrade Emmanuel On­wubiko, its Coordinator, said a letter from the National Assembly had debunked that Hon. Emeka Chinedu promot­ed such a bill. The letter declared that Onwubiko had not spon­sored any bill since this year and such a bill did not exist anywhere in the National Assembly. The letter added: “”What happened is that the same man who was defeated again in this 2023 election may have paid some Twitter tigers to make it look like it was a new development and it caught the gullibility of Nigerians again.” Besides, HURIWA applaud­ed the Federal High Court Abuja, which on Wednesday stopped the National Broad­casting Commission (NBC) from further imposing fines on broadcast stations in the country. In a judgment, Justice James Omotosho voided the N500,000 fines imposed by the NBC on 45 broadcast stations on March 1, 2019.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Justice Omotosho was of the view that the NBC, not being a court of law, lacked power to impose sanctions as punishment on alleged erring broadcast stations. POLL The judge held that the NBC Code, on which the commission relied to impose sanction, was in conflict with Section 6 of the Constitution that vested judicial power in the court of law. He said the court would not sit idly and watch a body im­posing fine arbitrarily with­out the recourse to the law, adding that the commission did not comply with the law when it sat as a complainant and at the same time, a court and a judge on its own case.
