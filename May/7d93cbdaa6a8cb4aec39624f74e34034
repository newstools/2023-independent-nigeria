LAGOS  – Watergen, a global leader in atmo­spheric drinking water generating devices, has launched in Nigeria, with Macif Projects and Distribu­tion Limited (Macif) as its exclusive distributor. Macif, in partnership with Wa­tergen, brings this innovative tech­nology and solution for providing clean and sustainable water from the air extracted from the atmo­sphere to Nigerians, a statement said. Watergen’s innovative solution is based on a world-wide, patented unique heat exchange technology that is safe, effective, economical, and most importantly, environmen­tally friendly. These water-generating de­vices are plug-and-drink i.e. they are used to create drinking water sources right at the point of con­sumption thereby eliminating the carbon-intensive supply chains and the environmentally harmful plas­tic wastes that cannot be recycled. Dr. Michael Mirilashvili, Wa­tergen’s President & Owner, said, “I am very happy that we have such a great partner as Nzan Ogbe, that cares for his nation and shares our principles and values in his decision to provide Watergen – safe, high quality and tastiest drinking water from air to the Nigerian peo­ple. We will certainly support every goodwill of our partner.” Speaking, Ukonwa Ikedife, Di­rector, Macif Projects and Distri­butions Limited said, “Given that access to safe drinking water is a basic human right and the World Health Organization has placed the number of Nigerians with ac­cess to safe drinking water at only 19%, Nigeria continues to strug­gle with providing safe and clean drinking water. Our partnership with Watergen seeks to close this gap while reducing our carbon footprint in contribution towards global climate action.”
