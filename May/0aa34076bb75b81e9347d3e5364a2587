Ahead of the English Premier League match, Manchester United could be without top scorer Marcus Rashford when they host Wolves on Saturday. Erik ten Hag’s men are looking to get their Champions League qualification bid back on track against the Foxes. United have suffered back-to-back defeats against Brighton and West Ham in the league, opening the door for rivals Liverpool in fifth place as the race for a top-four finish hots up. Ten Hag, speaking to reporters on Friday, confirmed his squad would be boosted by the return of centre-back Raphael Varane, who has sat out the last seven matches. However, Rashford who has scored 29 goals this campaign, is set to be unavailable. “Raphael Varane is back, Marcus Rashford is doubtful. “He has a problem on his leg, an injury, so he is a big question mark for [Saturday],” Ten Hag said.
