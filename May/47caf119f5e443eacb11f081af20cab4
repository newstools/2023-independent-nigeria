IBADAN  – The Chairman and Group Managing Director of Ajanaku Holdings, Otunba Rotimi Ajanaku, has broken his silence on the rumour surrounding the ownership of Dino Hotels, both in Ibadan and Lagos. Ajanaku who spoke with journalists from his Banana Island residence on Friday described those spreading crooked news that Ajanaku Holdings has sold its hotels as uninformed vendors and ignoramuses, who move around cities disseminating fake news in favour of their paymasters or for dubious purposes without considering the consequences. “Our hotels, Dino Hotel in Imalefalafia Street, Ibadan, as well as the one in Fola Osibo Street, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos re­main the property of Ajanaku Holdings, nothing has changed and there is no plan nor inten­tion to change the ownership of the two hotels. Besides, we have never listed any of the hotels for sale, so we wouldn’t know where the fake informa­tion is coming out from. “We have recently engaged the services of Hotel Manage­ment Companies to manage the two hotels, which is of course the modern system of running and managing hotels across the globe. Dino Hotel in Ibadan is under the manage­ment of Meltons Signature, while Nook Hotel manages the one in Lekki, Lagos. “We would have ordinarily ignored the fake news but it would not be in the interest of the public and could possibly encourage fraudsters to per­sist in misleading and duping members of the public, as well as unsuspecting investors who might possibly be poor in car­rying out investigation before investing in new business.”
