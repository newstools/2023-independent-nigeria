The Nigerian talent, who has been instrumental in Leicester City’s offensive threats this season, has caught the attention of the Italian side. Following this, the Super Eagles striker is therefore said to be a potential possibility for acquisition for the San Siro outfit when the summer transfer market opens, according to a report by Inter Live. Inter Milan, according to Football Insider, is willing to sell Lautaro Martinez this summer in order to raise funds for the summer transfer window. However, they are in a hot chase for a perfect replacement for the Argentine striker if they eventually sell off the forward in the coming transfer window. The East Midlands, who moved up to 16th in the standings following their draw with Everton, are in for a big summer with several players’ contracts about to expire and Iheanacho’s contract left with a year. Despite this, rumours suggest that Iheanacho will be leaving Leicester if Dean Smith’s team does not manage to keep their Premier League position. POLL The Nigerian international is entering the last year of his contract. Thus, Inter Live does not completely rule out the possibility that he would leave even if the Foxes remain in the Premier League. (SOURCE: Soccernet)
