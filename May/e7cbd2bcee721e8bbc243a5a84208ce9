A Senatorial aspirant of the Northern Senatorial District in the Cross River State All Progres­sives Congress (APC) primaries held last year, Barrister Cecilia Omonya Adams, has drummed support for Senator Godswill Ak­pabio’s bid to become the Senate President in the 10th National Assembly (NASS) expected to be inaugurated on June 13. Adams, who stated this in an interaction with newsmen in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, noted that since the enthronement of the current democratic dispensation in 1999, no one from the South-South geopolitical zone of the country has held the position of Senate President. According to her, “Now is the right time, in fairness and equi­ty, for the zone to have one of its own occupy the coveted seat of the Senate President.” The APC stalwart added: “Senator Godswill Akpabio is the right man for the position, having done well in delivering greater successes for the party in the just-concluded 2023 gener­al elections by not only winning his senatorial seat, but garnering 132,683 votes for the presidential election in Akwa Ibom State for President-elect, Ahmed Bola Tinubu. “In view of the above and in line with the APC Governors’ memo to the president-elect, His Excellency, Senator Ahmed Bola Tinubu on the appropriate zoning of the offices, which re­quested the contributions to the presidential election as a major factor, the South-South carries the day against the voting pattern of the South-East,” he noted. The former senatorial aspi­rant further stated that the excel­lent records qualified him for the position of the Senate President, having served as a commissioner, governor, minister and a ranking member of the Senate.
