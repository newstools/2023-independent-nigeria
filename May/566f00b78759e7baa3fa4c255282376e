LAGOS – Airbus, the airplane manufacturing company delivered 127 commercial aircraft in the first quarter (Q1) of 2023. This was contained in the Airbus consolidated financial results for the Q1 ending March 31, 2023. Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer (CEO) said that the quarter confirmed strong demand for its products, particularly for commercial aircraft. Faury also said that the quarter benefited from a good performance in helicopters despite the adverse operating environment that includes in particular persistent tensions in the supply chain, which confront the airlines and other companies across the world. He insisted that its 2023 guidance was unchanged with commercial aircraft deliveries expected to be backloaded. “We remain focused on delivering the commercial aircraft ramp-up and longer-term transformation,” he said. Gross commercial aircraft orders totalled 156 (Q1 2022: 253 aircraft), with net orders of 142 aircraft after cancellations (Q1 2022: 83 aircraft).‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The order backlog amounted to 7,254 commercial aircraft at the end of March 2023. POLL Airbus Helicopters registered 39 net orders (Q1 2022: 56 units), which were well spread across programmes. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value was € 2.5 billion (Q1 2022: € 3.2 billion). Consolidated revenues decreased slightly to € 11.8 billion (Q1 2022: € 12.0 billion). A total of 127 commercial aircraft were delivered, comprising 10 A220s, 106 A320 Family, 6 A330s and 5 A350s. Revenues generated by Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities decreased five percent year-on-year, mainly reflecting the lower deliveries, partly offset by the strengthening of the US dollar. Airbus Helicopters deliveries increased to 71 units (Q1 2022: 39 units), mainly driven by the Light helicopter segment. The division’s revenues rose 26 per cent, mainly reflecting deliveries and solid performance across programmes, favourable mix effects as well as a good start to the year in services. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space decreased 6 per cent, mainly driven by lower volume in Military Air Systems and in Space Systems. One A400M transport aircraft was delivered in Q1 2023. Consolidated Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) adjusted – an alternative performance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – decreased to € 773 million (Q1 2022: € 1,263 million). EBIT adjusted related to Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities decreased to € 580 million (Q1 2022: € 1,065 million). The decrease reflects the lower deliveries, a slightly less favourable hedge rate compared to Q1 2022 and investments for preparing for the future. Q1 2022 included the positive impact of retirement obligations partly offset by the impact resulting from international sanctions against Russia. The ramp-up on the A220 programme is continuing towards a monthly production rate of 14 aircraft by the middle of the decade. On the A320 Family programme, the company continues to ramp up towards a monthly production rate of 65 aircraft by the end of 2024. The recently announced decision to add a second Final Assembly Line in Tianjin will increase global industrial capacity to 10 Final Assembly Lines for the A320 Family, supporting Airbus’ plans to produce 75 aircraft per month in 2026. The flight test programme of the A321XLR is progressing and entry-into-service is expected to take place in Q2 2024. As previously announced, the company targets rate four for the A330 in 2024 and rate nine for the A350 at the end of 2025. On the A350F, the first components were recently produced by Airbus Atlantic in Nantes. As the first milestones are reached, the industrial planning for this variant is being slightly adjusted with the entry-into-service now slipping into 2026.
