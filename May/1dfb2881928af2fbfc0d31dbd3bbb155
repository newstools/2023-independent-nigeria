Prof. Abdullahi Mustapha, Director General/Chief Exec­utive Officer of the National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA), has said agricultural biotechnology remains the key to combating hunger and malnutrition in Nigeria and Africa. Mustapha stated this in Abuja at the ‘World Hunger Day’ Dinner and the Launch of ‘National Farmers Day’ organised by the Alliance for Science in collaboration with the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology (OFAB) in Africa, Nigeria Chapter, under the auspices of NABDA and the African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF), Nairo­bi, Kenya. He explained that agricul­tural biotechnology could play a significant role in end­ing hunger in the country. Commenting on the es­sence of the World Hunger Day’ Dinner, the NABDA boss explained that it was organ­ised to honour farmers and raise awareness about the im­portant role farmers play in ensuring food security, and at the same time discuss the im­portance of National Farmers Day and how it can be imple­mented in the country. According to him, “We are bringing together a cream of distinguished per­sonalities to discuss ways of promoting sustainable agri­cultural practices that will support government efforts in addressing the challenges of food and nutritional se­curity. “The event will highlight the importance of scientific innovations in tackling the food crisis.” Also speaking, Dr Rose Gi­dado, Director, Agricultural Biotechnology Department, NABDA, while acknowledg­ing that significant strides have been made in reducing hunger and malnutrition, said much work still needs to be done, especially in the Global South. Gidado noted that one of the ways to address the issue of hunger and mal­nutrition is by supporting and recognising the con­tributions of smallholder farmers who grow crops and foods that are the back­bone of the food systems in these countries.
