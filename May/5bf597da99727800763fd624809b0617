Actor Jamie Foxx has spoken out for the first time since his mysterious hospitalization. The Hollywood star has taken to social media to release his first public comment in three weeks. Little is known about Foxx’s condition, other than that he seems to be improving and on the mend. He was in Atlanta to shoot the Netflix movie ‘Back in Action’ in which he will co-star with Cameron Diaz. Then, on April 12, Foxx’s daughter, Corinne revealed that her father had “experienced a medical complication” the day before. She also said at the time that “due to quick action and great care, he is on his way to recovery.” Now, Foxx himself has made his first comments on the issue, but he has limited his words to a brief thank you to his fans and well-wishers. “Appreciate all the love!!! Feeling blessed,” the actor wrote on Instagram. Recently, it was announced that another actor, Nick Cannon will be filling in for Jamie Foxx as guest host of Fox game show Beat Shazam after the latter remains hospitalized.
