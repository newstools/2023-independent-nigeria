As Nigerians await the inaugu­ration of the 10th National As­sembly, the apex sociopolitical youth group in the South East-dubbed “Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL) has contended that the position of Senate President is zoned to the region (SE), urging all senators to support the region achieve the ambition. Consequently, the Coalition has cautioned a Group “Cen­tre for Excellence and Perfor­mance in Governance” (CEPG) currently parading itself as a watchdog and arrant-garde of the crusade to make the set­tle for a lower position in the zoning of the APC National Assembly principal positions to desist forthwith. In a statement jointly signed by President General – Good­luck Ibem and Publicity Secre­tary Okey Nwaoru which was made available to newsmen, COSELY queried the signifi­cance of the post of the Deputy Speaker of the House of Rep­resentatives to the SouthEast acknowledged as one of the most populous ethnic national­ities in the country and whose contributions to the nation’s Independence and liberation is indubitable. Ibem noted that in the histo­ry of the nation, the Igbo had never been consigned nor rel­egated to irrelevance as is be­ing done now stating that the action of the CEPG is a huge embarrassment to such great Igbo Leaders as the Late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Dr. M.I Okpa­ra, Dr. Akanu Ibiam and Chief Sam Mbawe who all fought to reposition the Igbo before, during and after the civil war.
