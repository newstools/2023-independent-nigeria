Former Presidential aide, Reno Omokri has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to plead with the British monarch, King Charles III for a royal prerogative of mercy for former deputy senate president, Ike Ekweremadu. A UK Court on Friday sentenced Ekweremadu to 9 years and eight months, while his wife Beatrice and Obinna Obetta got four years and ten years jail terms, respectively. Reacting tobthis, Omokri via his Twitter handle urged President Buhari to seek for a royal pardon for Ekweremadu as a parting gift to Nigeria adding that history will remember him for good if the request is granted. He tweeted, “As a parting gift to Nigeria, I appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari to use his private audience with King Charles III to appeal for a royal prerogative of mercy for Senator Ike Ekweremadu, which is within the power of the British monarch. “The President will forever be appreciated and remembered for this gesture to a man who has served Nigeria loyally and dedicatedly and who only committed the crime he was convicted of because of desperation, as a loving father of a child in dire need of a kidney transplant.”
