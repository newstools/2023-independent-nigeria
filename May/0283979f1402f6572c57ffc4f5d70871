The National Drug Law En­forcement Agency (NDLEA) has launched a nationwide raid of drug joints in an exer­cise code-named ‘Operation Mop Up’ to ensure the peace­ful inauguration of the new administrations at national and sub-national levels on May 29. No fewer than 534 suspects have already been arrested in the first few days of the com­mencement of the operation, during which tons of illicit drugs including cocaine, her­oin, methamphetamine, tra­madol, codeine-based syrup, cannabis sativa and various new psychoactive substanc­es among others, were recov­ered across the states and the FCT. Top on the list with high arrests and seizures are Lagos, Kano, Abuja, Kaduna, Rivers, Bayelsa, Adamawa, Osun, Benue and Plateau. Femi Babafemi, NDLEA’s Director of Media & Advoca­cy, in a release, said the Chair­man/Chief Executive Officer of the agency, Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (rtd), who or­dered the operation, com­mended the officers and men of the state commands and other formations involved in the exercise for their pro­fessionalism and standard operating procedure. “I’m impressed by the level of compliance with the directive to all our commands and formations to dismantle all drug joints within their ar­eas of responsibility, mop up all illicit substances in such locations and arrest all those culpable. “This will in no small measure take out of the equation, enablers of crime and violence such as illicit drugs, their dealers and all those relying on mind-alter­ing substances to disrupt the May 29 inauguration ceremo­nies across the states and the Federal Capital Territory,” Marwa stated. He charged them to con­tinue with the operational maxim of ‘offensive action’ against drug cartels and traf­fickers until the last gram of illicit drug is taken out of the streets and communities across the country.
