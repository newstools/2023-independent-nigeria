LAGOS – The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), has called on the members-elect of the 10th National Assembly to give particular consideration to the principle of national unity, competence and equity in electing the next set of the National Assembly’s principal officers. In a statement issued on Friday, signed the CUPP’s National Co-Spokesperson, Comrade Mark Adebayo, CUPP stated that, “All hands must be on deck to ensure that justice prevails in choosing the next set of National Assembly principal officers particularly the Senate President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. “The ethnoreligious configurations of Nigeria must be taken into deliberate consideration in deciding who and who emerge the next Senate President and Speaker of the House. “Every region and religion and all-round leadership capacity must be put at the forefront of consideration for choosing those to occupy those sensitive positions in order to give a sense of belonging to everyone in the Nigerian project. To ignore these crucial factors is to set up the country for intractable distrust and crises. “We call on all stakeholders in this assignment to ensure that justice is not only done but clearly seen to be done in the final analysis. Never allow pecuniary factors to determine the choices to be made but, primarily and fundamentally, national unity, equity and leadership capacity should be the central considerations for choosing the next Senate and House leadership. “CUPP will continue to watch closely the processes that would lead to the emergence of these important officers and will not support any underhand dealings that may compromise the peace and unity of the country. The next set of National Assembly leaders must be men or women of integrity, competency, undoubted patriotism and creative leadership credentials,” Adebayo added.
