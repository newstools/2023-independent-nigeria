LAGOS – The National Consultative Front (NCFront), the initiating platform of the Big Tent of Citizens and Stakeholders of Conscience working for a new Nigeria has said the imposition of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Kashim Shettima as president and vice president respectively is an invitation to self-help and anarchy by Buhari’s government. The group in a press statement on Monday signed by Olubori Obafemi, media assistant to the director general, NCFront expressed disappointment in the way the Buhari government and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), under the leadership of Mahmood Yakubu have mismanaged and discredited democracy in Nigeria by forcefully foisting an illegitimate government of Tinubu on Nigerians in spite the irregularities and malpractices that characterised the 2023 presidential election. The statement reads, “We wish to warn the rulers of Nigeria that a situation, where they continually choose to ride roughshod on the will of the Nigerian people in flagrant breach of the country’s affirmation to run on constitutional democracy, is a blatant invitation to self-help and anarchy, where the people will be forced to ignore democratic norm and rule of law in enforcing their collective and popular will over growing clique rule in Nigeria. “To this end, in saving Nigeria and defending our desecrated democracy, we have resolved to rise up in the succeeding days to mobilise and engage eminent citizens and stakeholders of conscience in Nigeria and the international community to rally immediate support to defend and save our people from imminent anarchy and another round of “June 12 struggle” towards the restoration of credible elections in Nigeria. “For us, the biggest culprits in the present massacre of democracy and justice in Nigeria is Muhammadu Buhari and his lackey, Prof Mamood Yakubu, the ignominious INEC chairman, who in a desperate gestapo manner hurriedly imposed Bola Tinubu on the country in spite of all evidences put before him by other contestants during the collation of the presidential election. “He can therefore not be trusted by the Nigerian people to preside over any election again in Nigeria if such election must be respected by Nigerians.”
