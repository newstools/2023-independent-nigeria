The governor of Kaduna state, Nasir El-Rufai has reacted to reports suggesting that he may become the Chief of Staff to the President-elect, Bola Tinubu, saying he is not aiming for the office. There have been reports due to his closeness to Tinubu during the electioneering period, that El-Rufai was of those being considered for the position of the president-elect’s Chief of Staff. However, El-Rufai said he would rather remain in the private sector while contributing to Nigeria’s development. The governor spoke while commissioning the Gombe Geographic Information Systems service centre, on Saturday. “I will be leaving in 22 days, but I will be available anytime you need a troublemaker. “I will be in the private sector, I’m not going to be any chief of staff. I will take a break and advice people like Governor Inuwa Yahaya, if they need it.” He said.
