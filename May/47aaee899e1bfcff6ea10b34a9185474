The Board of Trustees of the Aliko Dangote Foundation has resolved to be fully involved in the evacuation and resettling of thousands of Nigerians that are stranded in war-torn Sudan. Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Aliko Dangote Foundation (ADF), Zouera Youssoufou, has been in contact with the man­agement of Air Peace and the Federal Government to indicate the Foundation’s readiness to support the stranded Nigerians. She said: “The Foundation will collaborate with the Feder­al Government and Air Peace in ensuring seamless transpor­tation of the stranded Nigerians and more importantly provide logistics and succour to the evacuees, to make them settle more comfortably when they return to Nigeria.” The Foundation MD further stated that ADF’s understands the challenges of the Federal Government and Air Peace involved in this mission and has contacted relevant Federal Government agencies, involved in humanitarian disaster relief intervention, “…indicating our interest in collaborating with them to ensure that all Nige­rians stranded in Sudan are brought back home safely.” It would be recalled that Aliko Dangote Foundation supported the Nigerian govern­ment with logistics support for the Nigerian volunteer health workers who supported the Ebola containment efforts in Libe­ria and Sierra Leone upon their return to the country in 2015. ­ Also, during the recent COVID pandemic, ADF sup­ported the return of Nigerians from India and Dubai during the outbreak of the pandemic with specially chartered flights and COVID testing and quaran­tining when they arrived back in Nigeria. Since 2011, ADF has supported several thousand IDPs in Yobe, Borno, Adamawa, and Abuja with a total spending of over N25 billion in the provi­sion of food, shelter, and health services. Meanwhile, a joint press release from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Minis­try of Humanitarian Affairs, Di­saster Management, and Social Development revealed that the first batch of 13 buses conveying 637 evacuees had arrived at the identified safe borders at As­wan, Egypt, and are undergoing necessary documentation and clearance before admission into the Egyptian territory for their eventual evacuation to Nigeria.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Sudan has been experienc­ing intense clashes between the country’s military and the main paramilitary force. Hun­dreds of people have been killed, while thousands that are fleeing the war are reported stranded on the Sudan-Egypt border because of visa requirements demanded by Egypt.
