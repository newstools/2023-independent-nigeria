AKURE  – Cocoa farmers in Oluwa Forest reserve in Ondo State have appealed to Governor Oluwarotimi Ak­eredolu to compel a private company, SAO Agro-Allied Services Limited, to com­ply with the court order restraining it from further grading of cocoa planta­tions and farmlands in the forest. In a letter addressed to the governor through their attor­ney, Tope Temokun, the farm­ers stated that the company to which the state government had allocated farmland in the forest had been restrained by court or order but refused to obey.
