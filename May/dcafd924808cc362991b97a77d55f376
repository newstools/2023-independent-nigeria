YENAGOA  – The Bayelsa State Gov­ernment has directed the leadership and stakeholders of com­munities that are yet to form vigilantes to complement the efforts of conventional security agencies to do so immediately. The deputy governor, Law­rence Ehwrudjakpo, who gave the order while granting audience to some stakehold­ers of the Ovom community in Government House, Yena­goa, explained that the move would enable the government to improve on the prevailing peace and security in the state.

Commending the Ovom people in the Yenagoa Local Government Area for their patience and understanding so far as hosts to the seat of power in the state, he stated that the government would do more to improve their so­cio-economic well-being and development.
