ABUJA – The Labour Party (LP) on Monday said its doors remained open to those vying for principal offic­es at the National Assembly. The party’s remarks came in the wake of reports that it was in bed with lawmakers from the All Progressives Congress (APC) who are seeking to be elected as principal officers of the Senate and the House of Representa­tives. Recall that on Friday last week, suspended former Na­tional Publicity Secretary, Aba­yomi Arabambi, had accused the National Chairman, Julius Abure, and some party officials of entertaining APC lawmakers at the expense of the party. But National Secretary of the LP, Umar Farouk, on Monday at the party’s secretariat, debunked Arabambi’s allegation, insisting rather that the Labour Party was poised to provide better welfare for Nigerians. According to him, to achieve this, “we will partner with those willing to partner with us. But our lawmakers at the National Assembly will continue to give us updates on developments there.” Farouk made the disclosure at a world press conference ahead of a one-day summit for all its elected candidates organised by LP Diaspora wing. Speaking at the conference, the summit’s Media Committee chairman, Yunusa Tanko, said the conference would focus on impactful leadership and good governance, building synergies for the new Nigeria of our dream, law making, constitution and de­mocracy, among others. He added that the gathering would enable the party to brief its legislators and governor-elect on the brand of politics that is people’s oriented.
