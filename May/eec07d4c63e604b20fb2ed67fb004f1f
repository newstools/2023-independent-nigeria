How time flies: itâ€™s one year since the mercurial and officious Barrister Tokunbo Wahab clocked 50. Just like yesterday, the reliable and ever workaholic Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State on Education has added another year, but unlike his pomp golden jubilee celebration last year, his 51st birthday was celebrated in a very low key as there is more to do on his desk than rolling out the drums to mark another year. Toks, as he is fondly called, has been a very dependable and veritable instrument in the areas of education and he is still not done. So committed and diligent in his portfolio as an SA on Education to Governor SanwoOlu that many are even forgetting that his first calling as a lawyer is no longer being taken into consideration because of the many giant strides he has brought into the educational sector, which many states are now trying to copy. At 51, Barrister Tokunbo Wahab is a good hand for any administrator who wishes to deliver the dividends of democracy and good values to the people. Who knows, Toks may play prominently well in bigger capacities in the next dispensation and will surely not disappoint his associates and fans of Center of Excellence.
