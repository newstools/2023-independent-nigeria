The former lawmaker said: “I am delighted to hear about the approval of the Ondo Deep Sea Port in our state. This is a significant achievement and a major milestone for our state’s economic development. “The relentless effort of Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Odunayo Akeredolu, SAN, CON, at ensuring that the seaport materialises is an attestation of the governor’s determination to ensure a greater Ondo State. “The establishment of a seaport will no doubt provide numerous benefits to Ondo State, including increased trade, tourism, and transpor­tation opportunities.
