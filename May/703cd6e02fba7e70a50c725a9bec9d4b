According to SPORT, Barcelona are strongly considering Wolverhampton Wanderers’ latest offer for star player Ansu Fati. The Premier League outfit, via superagent Jorge Mendes, have recently submitted a €30 million proposal for Fati, but have included Ruben Neves in the deal. The offer has appeared quite appealing to Barça, who are actively looking for a new defensive midfielder in the market while hoping to cash in on some of their players. Fati is one of many players facing an uncertain future at Camp Nou, as Barcelona look to reduce the cost of the workforce and generate new income. Fati has been linked with moves to Manchester United and Arsenal, among other Premier League giants. But nothing has materialised so far, which is why his agent Jorge Mendes is keen on convincing the player to join Wolves. Barcelona, for their part, are open to accepting the deal, as they are happy with the terms offered. Although it is no secret that coach Xavi Hernandez has no desire to sign Ruben Neves, he may have no choice but to abide by the club’s decision, especially under the current economic circumstances. There have been calls for Barcelona to sign Sofyan Amrabat in recent days, but signing the Fiorentina star could be tricky unless the club get rid of its first-team stars. POLL That is why Wolves’ deal appears very appealing to Barça, as they can not only sign a new midfielder but also sanction the sale of Fati, whose agent has been trying to convince him that Wolves will be an intermediate destination for him. Mendes argues that Fati will be able to join a bigger club once he makes an impact at Wolves. He has clarified the player will not have to spend more than two years at the club. Despite this, Fati is not convinced yet and will have a talk with Xavi come the end of the season.
