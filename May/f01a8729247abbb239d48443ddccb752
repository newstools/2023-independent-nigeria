LAGOS  – The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has expressed optimism over the impacts of the 650,000 barrels per day Dangote Refinery which is billed for launch by President Muhammadu Buhari next week. Dr.Chinyere Almona, its Director-General, said the project will be sufficient to meet Nigeria’s need for refined petroleum products. LCCI, she said, views the refinery’s impact on the Nigerian economy as significant, adding that it will save and generate foreign exchange. According to her, the refinery will create jobs, positively affect the value of the Naira, broaden prosperity for the downstream sector, and provide growth opportunities for businesses. It will also stimulate economic growth by impacting the country’s balance of payments, she said. She added: “In addition, the Chamber expects the Refinery to fuel further growth and development across its value chain, including cosmetics, plastics, textiles, etc. We also see room for the development of added value in agribusiness, including the Sugar Backward Integration projects that plan to create a strong localized supply in the sugar industry, benefiting local suppliers across the sugar value chain. “Finally, the Chamber notes that this initiative presents Nigeria as an attractive investment destination for local and foreign investors. Therefore, the LCCI urges the government to strengthen its commitment to creating an enabling environment for businesses” ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
