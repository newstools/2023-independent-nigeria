ABUJA – The incoming governors have been charged to increase internally generate revenue in their states and resist over-dependence on the federal government. Emmanuel Emefienim, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Premium Trust Bank, made the call on Monday at the ongoing 2023 Induction Programme for new and returning governors in Abuja. Speaking on the sidelines of the event, Emefienim said new state executives should come up with innovative ways of generating revenues and stop the over-dependence on the center to develop their states. “They should come up with innovative ways of raising IGR that they can use to drive development in their states. The moment you are less dependent on the center the more you have the capacity to do more for your people and once that is done, infrastructural development will take place, you will deliver more dividends of democracy to the betterment of the people.” On areas the state executives should concentrate on to generate IGR, Emefienim said, “It differs from state to state. What could be the major drivers for revenue in an oil-producing state may not be the same for a state like Anambra or Abia, where you have retail businesses. It is for the governors to determine what work for them and how best they can harness the opportunities available in their environment.” Emefienim, who said Premium Trust Bank, was one of the sponsors of the event, welcomed the induction programme, saying it will position the governors to provide the right leadership in their various states. “It is something everyone needs to support, it’s something you just leave to government. We feel that the private sector has a role to play in good governance, accountability and development.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
