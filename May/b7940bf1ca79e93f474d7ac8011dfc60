ABUJA – The Spokesperson of the Conference of United Political Parties (CUPP), and member-elect representing Ideato North South Federal Constituency in the 10th House of Representatives, Hon. Ikenga Ugochinyere has expressed delight over the endorsement of leading Speakership, Deputy Speakership hopefuls and All Progressive Congress consensus candidates, Hon. Abass Tajudeen and Hon. Benjamin Kalu by River state Governor, Nyesom Wike. Ugochinyere who’s the communication adviser for Tajudeen Abass, Ben Kalu (TBK) group, was among the many members-elect who accompanied the duo to visit the Governor on Friday, in River state. In a statement he personally signed, Ikenga who also recently with the support of 62 others declared their endorsement of the duo, described the visit as “a victory consolidation.” According to him, the other aspirants are wasting their time campaigning, because Abass and Kalu are “seconds away of emerging victorious.” Citing his earlier statement where he backed the duo’s ambition, he again appealed to the aggrieved aspirants to stepdown for Abass and Kalu. He said: “I and my other colleagues supporting APC’s anointed candidates, are again urging members-elect of the ruling and opposition parties to join hands and support Tajudeen Abbas and Benjamin Kalu. Just like I disclosed few days ago, this visit to Governor Wike, and more which will follow in the coming days, is a testament that we are ready for Nigerians to know that the TBK Group is fully in support of Abass and Kalu for Speaker, Deputy Speaker of the incoming tenth National Assembly. “We thank Governor Wike for supporting this great duo. I took time to analyze the background of Hon Abbas and Hon. Kalu, and they both have similarities, their track record shows men with focus, believe in hard work, competent and humble,” the member-elect said.
