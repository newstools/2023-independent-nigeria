It’s like things are perfectly falling in place for the former two-time governor of Akwa Ibom State and former Minister for Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio. His victory at the last general election may have been the propelling force for him to aspire towards the Presidency of the Red Chamber in the National Assembly and may just be inches away from becoming Nigeria’s number three person all things being equal. Having performed excellently well for two terms as governor of his home state and credibly well too as a Minister of the Niger/Delta region, the plum sea of Senate president looks too sure for the taking for the lawyer-trained-cum-politician and man of the people nationwide because other elected distinguished senators like him for the tenth assembly have been grandstanding openly for him to clinch the coveted office when the National Assembly is finally inaugurated in weeks’ time. An addendum to Akpabio’s glittering and sterling chances as Nigeria’s next Senate President is his very unassailable and cordial relationship with Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the president-elect who will be sworn-in on May 29, and this may come in handy for him when the battle for the Senate Presidency comes in full blast. Talk of a man with a big and tall dream steadily and stealthily coming to pass.
