Jamie Foxx’s friends and family are “preparing for the worst” following his medical emergency according to reports. Last month, while in Atlanta filming for his upcoming film ‘Back in Action’ with co-star Cameron Diaz, the beloved actor suffered a medical complication off set. Foxx’s family has not shared what exactly happened to the actor but has been offering updates indicating his condition is improving. Despite the word of his condition improving, Jamie Foxx’s condition remains in alarming concern as doctors continue to monitor the actor. The lack of information and general updates have led many to theorize about Foxx’s condition. One report said that Foxx’s condition was dire when he entered the hospital April 12 and noted an unnamed source saying, “But he wouldn’t be in a hospital this long if he was anything close to okay. His friends and family are hoping for the best but preparing for the worst!” Earlier this week, Jamie Foxx’s official Instagram account shared a post thanking fans for all the support. The post read, “Appreciate all the love!!! Feeling blessed,” followed simply by a fox emoji.
