The Bayelsa State National and State Houses of Assembly Elections Petition Tribunal sitting in Yenagoa has admonished litigants to desist from seeking unnecessary adjournments, filing frivolous applications and preliminary objections that are time-wasting and reportedly aimed at derailing justice. Justice O. M. Fagbemi, the chairperson of the tribunal, gave the advice while delivering her inaugural address to formally commence proceedings on Thursday. The tribunal has received a total of 31 petitions filed before the tribunal as of yesterday. Justice Fagbemi stated that since the tribunal was time-bound, it required the support and cooperation of all parties to administer justice. She said, “We solicit your support and cooperation in administering justice to all manner of people via a petition filed before the tribunal. As it is described, elections petitions before the tribunal are time bound and by their nature peculiar from other proceedings. “We undertake to abide by our oath of office and mandate in dispensing justice with the help of God almighty. “We seize this opportunity to admonish counsels and litigants to desist from seeking unnecessary incessant adjournments and filing of frivolous applications and preliminary objections which is time wasting, purely an academic exercise, an exercise in futility aimed at perverting the course of justice.” Speaking in an interview with journalists after the inaugural ceremony, the secretary of the tribunal, Abba Umaru Dahiru, said the court received 31 petitions. POLL He said that 22 of the petitions were for State House of Assembly and nine for National Assembly polls, adding that one petition had been withdrawn.
