ABUA  – Center for the Study of Economy In Africa, CSEA, has asked Federal Government its sub-national tiers to look elsewhere for its funding source after recent figures show that Bank credit to government has dropped with corresponding rise of same credit to the private sector. According to data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Money and Credit statistics, Banks’ credit to the private sector increased month-on-month (MoM) from N41.5 trillion in February 2023, to N43.06 trillion in March 2023. This represents a N1.6 trillion (4 percent) increase between February and March 2023. However, the data further shows that credit to the government fell MoM by 3 percent to N27.5 trillion in March 2023 from N28.4 trillion in February 2023. The credit to the private sector and the government resulted in a net domestic credit of N70.6 trillion (March 2023), representing a 0.56 percent MoM rise compared to N70.2 trillion in the previous month. The decline in credit to the government will reduce the risk of the crowding-out effect of government borrowing in the domestic financial market on the availability of funds to private firms for productive investments,” CSEA believes. The government should sustain this reduced credit by exploring alternative ways of raising finance and taking steps to boost revenue collection, such as digitalizing the tax collection process and widening the tax net. Furthermore, there is a need to utilize innovative financing options to effectively fund its rising expenditure to minimize the rate of borrowing from the domestic financial market, thereby reducing its debt burden. Also, banks must ensure that the credit issued to the private sector does not reach an unsustainable level to maintain healthy balance sheets and ensure that non-performing loans are avoided or kept at a minimal level. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ On the other hand, Money and Credit statistics data, also from CBN shows that currency-in-circulation (CIC), increased to N1.68 trillion in March 2023. POLL This represents a 71 percent increase from N982 billion CIC recorded in February 2023. Similarly, Currency outside Banks (CoB) increased Month-on-Month (MoM) by 66 percent to N1.4 trillion in March 2023, from N843 billion recorded in February 2023. This could be attributed to the impact of implementing the Supreme Court judgment, which stated that old N200, N500, and N1,000 notes should remain in circulation till December 31, 2023. This contradicts the response to the initial deadline for phasing out old Naira notes on January 31st, 2023, which saw CoB fall MoM by 70 percent to N788.9 billion in January 2023 from N2.6 trillion in December 2022. CIC fell MoM by 54 percent to N1.38 trillion in January 2023 from N3 trillion in December 2022 due to the naira scarcity experienced in the country. To keep inflation at a minimal level, which is one of the goals of the Naira redesign program, the Apex Bank should ensure that CIC and CoB are efficiently controlled.
