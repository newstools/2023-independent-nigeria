LAGOS – The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Seme Border Com­mand, said it has intercepted and seized a truckload of un­registered pharmaceuticals valued at N27.8 million. The command also disclosed that it earlier seized 553 parcels of canna­bis sativa otherwise known as Indian hemp. Dera Nnadi, Customs Area Control­ler (CAC) of the command, disclosed this during a press briefing. The Customs boss said that on May 9, 2023, at about 8.30 a.m., officers and men of his command, while conduct­ing a stop and search along Abidjan Lagos Corridor, intercepted a truck with registration number GL 6663 GH belonging to one of the major conglom­erates, laden with some concealed car­tons of pharmaceutical products. “The truck was taken to the station at Seme for proper examination and upon examination, the following un­registered pharmaceutical products were discovered: morphine sulfate 100ml x 1076 bottles, amodiaquine suspension 60ml x 94 bottles; vermox 500mg x 2970 packages x 1 sachet x 1 tablet, mepacrine tablets 100mg x 390 packets x 1000 tablets, CLOFENAC SR 100mg x 298 packets x 10 sachets x 10 tablets; losartail potassium 50mg x 1485 packages x 2 sachets x 28 tablets and virest 400 acyclovir tablets. B.P 400mg x 499 packages x 5 sachets x 5 tablets. “The seized unregistered pharma­ceutical products have a Duty Paid Value (DPV) of N27, 861,538.00.” The Customs Comptroller said that the seizure contravened both Nigeria Customs Service banning the importation of pharmaceutical products through the land border without approval and further contra­vening NAFDAC laws as they do not have NAFDAC registration numbers, adding that “five out of the seven seized pharmaceutical products have expired.” “The command and indeed every Nigerian is worried about this particu­lar seizure considering the dangerous use of morphine which is a derivate of opium. This drug can be deployed for illicit use to aid criminals. POLL “Let me reiterate our commitment to fight smuggling under any guise and also state that those trying our resolve will continue to meet their Waterloo as we remain resolute at ensuring ad­equate surveillance of our borders.”
