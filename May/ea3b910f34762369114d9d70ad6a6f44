LAGOS  – Economic activities in Lagos are driven by the population size, government macroeconomic and industrial policies, the presence of sea and airports, and relative security in the city, Professor Abiodun Folawewo of University of Ibadan, has said Folawewo , a Professor of Macroeconomics, Labour and Development Economics, in University of Ibadan, while presenting a paper on ‘Lagos Structural Transformation Domain Findings & PCP’s at the African Cities Research Consortium (ACRC) workshop in Lagos recently, said despite the boom in economic activities in Lagos, much effort is needed to achieve inclusive growth and effective structural transformation. He explained that the study examines the pattern and drivers of structural transformation in Lagos and the implications for inclusive growth and welfare. He emphasised that the study also called for ways to deal with shortage and poor state of infrastructure – power and transport network. “There is the alleged exploitation by touts who often claim to be working for LGAs and normally impose different kinds of levies on firms’ vehicles This is concerned has to do with a situation where business firms operating in Lagos have to pay different forms of multiple taxation, levies and fees imposes burden on income of business enterprises”, he said According to Folawewo, there is a significant variation in spatial distribution of business establishments in Lagos, with dominance of services sector in terms of share of establishments and employment. He noted that, although there is a shift away from agriculture, there is little or no structural transformation as the movement is largely into the low productive services sector with moderate movement into manufacturing – large informal employment with varying degree across the city POLL “Findings show low productivity across spatial distribution and sectors, with manufacturing sector having the highest productivity gains. “Economic activities are driven by key factors such as the population size, government macroeconomic and industrial policies, the presence of sea and airports, infrastructure (electricity, transportation network and ICT), industries, and relative security in the city. “Among major identified challenges to structural transformation in Lagos is inadequate infrastructure and transportation network due to excess demand arising from continuous rise in population, hostile business environment, and multiple taxation problems”
