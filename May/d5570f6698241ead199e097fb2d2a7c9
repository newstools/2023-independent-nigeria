The 23-year-old came through the Real Madrid youth system and made one appearance for the Spanish giants during the 2018/19 season before being shipped out on loan to Rayo in 2020. After helping the club to La Liga promotion, Garcia signed permanently for the club and has impressed in the top flight ever since. Following a season in which his side Rayo finished a respectable 11th in La Liga, the Spanish defender has now secured a move to his boyhood club Real Madrid. Speaking to the press after Los Blancos’ 2-1 victory over Rayo at the Santiago Bernabeu, Ancelotti confirmed the signing, revealing: “Fran Garcia is a left-back who has a lot of energy. He is very fast with the ball, and he attacks very well. “He is a very good profile for Real Madrid, and next year he will be with us.” Along with Garcia, Madrid are also working extremely hard to finalise a deal to sign Jude Bellingham this summer. 90min reported earlier in May that the dynamic midfielder has agreed personal terms with Real Madrid ahead of a blockbuster move. Real Madrid secured a last ditch win on Wednesday evening thanks to an 89th minute winner from Rodrygo Goes after Raul de Tomas cancelled out a first-half goal from Karim Benzema. The result sees Ancelotti’s side rise up to second in the La Liga table thanks to Atletico Madrid’s thrilling 3-3 draw with Espanyol.
