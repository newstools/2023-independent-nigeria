Fr Hyacinth Alia as the governorship candidate of the party for the 2023 elections in the state. Also suspended were ward of­ficials from two council wards and one council ward in Konshisha and Obi Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the state respectively. The decision to suspend the two governorship aspirants was reached at an expanded meeting of the par­ty, tagged: “Critical Expanded Exco Meeting” held at the State APC secre­tariat, Makurdi on Wednesday. Speaking at the occasion, Aga­da who observed that activities of the duo during the just concluded governorship election were against the interest of the APC noted that they also lost their various polling stations. The party chairman was piqued that apart from taking the party to court, the two aspirants also worked to ensure that the APC lost at the polls.
