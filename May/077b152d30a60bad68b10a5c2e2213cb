ABUJA – There are serious security checks going on at Eagle Square, Abuja, venue for the inauguration of the President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. As early as 6 am this morning, many invited guests were seen trouping into Eagle Square to take vantage seats ahead of the inauguration formalities which commences by 10 am. The security personnel spotted on duty by our correspondent were mostly drawn from the Nigerian Police Force, the Department of State Services, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), the military, officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) among others. Most of the roads linking the Federal Secretariat, where the Eagle Square is situated have been cordoned off, while dignitaries are made to walk up a short distance before gaining access through a single gate. As of the time of filing this brief report, most of the diplomatic community in the nation’s capital are already on the ground. Some traditional rulers, especially those from western Nigeria are seen walking into the venue. Some clergy were also seen trying to gain access to the VIP pavilion. The incoming President, Bola Tinubu and the outgoing President, Muhammadu Buhari are yet to arrive at the venue for the inauguration. More to come soon…
