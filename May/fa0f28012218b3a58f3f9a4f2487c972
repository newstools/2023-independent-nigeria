IBADAN – The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has urged Nigerians to report to the Commission any telecommunication companies that failed to resolve their complaints. The Head of the Consumer Affairs Bureau of NCC, Mr. Banji Ojo stated this during the 5th edition of the telecom campus conversation held at the University of Ibadan on Thursday while speaking on the topic “Data depletion issue: Tips on data usage for better quality of experience”. He informed the students that they have a right to complain to the commission in case telecommunication companies failed to resolve their issues, saying the role of NCC is to keep on informing the consumers about their rights. Ojo stressed that the commission has the duty to educate the consumers about the development in the sector. According to him, “When you bought data that was supposed to last for a period, unfortunately, it finished before the end of the period, that is what we called data depletion. “Our duty is to keep on informing our consumers, to educate them to know what they are into. Consumers are key. Without the consumers, there will be no NCC. “We have a code called 622. You dial it and it will take you to our agents, we have agents that will pick up your calls and speak with you in your language of choice.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “The essence of it is that we know that telecommunication companies may not be able to resolve your complaints, but we want to give the telecommunication consumers another platform to be able to complain. POLL “That is why we have the telecommunication consumers’ complains. Dial 622. The moment you send the message it will be relayed to us”.
