Martin Keown has labelled Leicester City a “disgrace” for finding themselves in the relegation zone. The Foxes have enjoyed success in relatively recent times under former manager Brenedan Rodgers. City won the FA Cup in 2021 and reached the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League last term but failed to ever get back into gear this season after a dreadful start to the campaign. Dean Smith’s side had gone three games unbeaten before coming unstuck against Fulham and falling 4-0 behind before half-time last weekend. The Foxes are now two points behind Everton and face a tough final trio of games with Liverpool, Newcastle and West Ham. Former City defender Keown didn’t hold back when asked about the club’s survival chances. “It’s easier to say it. Leicester have lost 21 games this season, do you really deserve to be in the Premier league when you look at their record?” he told Football Focus. “I think it’s been shocking. “When you look at the quality of players there, it’s almost a disgrace because that quality of player should never be landing in the Championship. “I must say, though, if you’re seeing Everton win at Brighton in the manner that they did, it must give everybody else hope. Brighton were really given a lesson then because their tactics were wrong and Everton punished them. It was remarkable to see. “It’s been a long season for these teams and I don’t see the bottom three changing right now.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Leicester City host an in-form Liverpool side on Monday night, with Jurgen Klopp’s men having won their past six games. A positive result would be a real statement for Smith’s team and significantly boost their chances of achieving safety, heading into the final two games of the season.
