LAGOS – Youth Alive Foundation, a Non-Governmental Or­ganisation (NGO), has sensitised traditional rul­ers, their subjects, market women and men in Makoko Community of Lagos State on the existing law which they can leverage to fight violence against women and the girl child. Speaking at the event yesterday, Feyikemi Fabiyi Omoniyi, the Programme Officer, Youth Alive Foun­dation, disclosed that the programme was a commu­nity sensitisation and town hall meeting sponsored by Commonwealth Founda­tion, through Youth Alive Foundation. She said, “We partnered with different organisa­tions and NGOs. We call it Safeguarding Against Violence and Exploitation of Women and Girls in La­gos, and the reason is that there is a Law called VAPP, Violence Against Person Prohibition Act 2015, which has been domesticated at the national level. “We want to reach out to legislators, government and stakeholders in Lagos State. Through our advoca­cy Domestic and Sexual Vi­olence Agency was created, and through that, a law was domesticated in 2021, called Domestic and Sexual Vio­lence Law, the law is still in existence to protect women and girls from all sorts of violence and exploitation. “We are currently doing community sensitisation, through roadwork and town hall meetings. We’ve covered Ikorodu and Ali­mosho, and today we are in Makoko, Yaba axis, to sensitise the community on the provision that the law has made for us, so that they’re enlightened, and not die in silence.
