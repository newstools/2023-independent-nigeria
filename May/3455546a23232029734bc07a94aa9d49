ABUJA  – The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 election, Ati­ku Abubakar, has expressed concern over the call by the United States Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, to the Presi­dent-elect, Bola Tinubu, despite questioning the legitimacy of his election. Atiku, in his response to Blinken in a tweet on his veri­fied handle @atiku said, “I am in disbelief that Secretary Antony Blinken called Tinubu, a con­tradiction to the publicly stated position of the US on Nigeria’s 2023 presidential election. “This is inconceivable con­sidering that America, as the bastion of democracy, is well briefed on the sham election of February 25. “To give legitimacy to the widely acknowledged fraudu­lent election in Nigeria can be de­moralising to citizens who have hedged their bet on democracy and the sanctity of the ballot.”
