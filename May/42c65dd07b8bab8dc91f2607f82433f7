In his speech to the Lagos State Parks and Garages chairman, Kcee described him as a powerful and great man. “We need to put some little cash in a tray like this no matter how little. That’s how we roll. MC, you are a powerful man, you are a great man, we appreciate you and we celebrate your presence in our home. You guys are welcome, this is just a token from our heart,” he said. Over the years, E-Money has become known as a cheerful giver as the billionaire never ceases to give out money to celebrities, fans, lovers, and the less privileged.
