Gunmen have killed two people in Mawofi village, Atyap Chiefdom, Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State. A source told Daily Post that so many houses were burnt down by the attackers who stormed the village in their large numbers on Friday night. According to the source, “How can one explain a situation where the attackers moved from one village in Atyap land to another perpetuating their mission without anyone stopping them? “It is now for the world to see and judge if these attacks are reprisals or purely attacks by the perpetrators to achieve their evil mission.” He explained that residents were still searching for their loved ones to ascertain the number of casualties. Meanwhile, the Kaduna Police Command spokesman, DSP Mohammed Jalige is yet to confirm the incident.
