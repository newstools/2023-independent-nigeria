The Lagos Leather Fair is set to launch the Lagos Leather Fair Accelerator Programme (LLF) to showcase the potential value of the leather industry in Nigeria and Africa. The launching of the 2023 edition would celebrate its sixth year of Lagos Leather Fair which has consistently maintained its leading position as the driving force behind the realisation of the untapped opportunities in the Nigerian leather ecosystem and Africa as a whole. The 2023 edition themed Staying Ahead: Creativity Collaboration Commitment will take place from the 17th to 18th of June in Victoria Island, Lagos. The Leather Fair will bring together indigenous brands, emerging and established designers as well as international brands to showcase their products and services to the defined audience. The launching of the LLF Accelerator Programme will grow and strengthen their skills and acquire critical knowledge with the help of entrepreneurs who possess the relevant industry experience. Speaking on the announcement of LLF2023, the founder of Lagos Leather Fair, Femi Olayebi said: “the annual celebration of Lagos Leather Fair is a proof point of our unflinching commitment towards finding sustainable solutions to scale the African leather industry and ensure that the Made-in-Nigeria Project and Zero-Oil Initiative becomes a reality.” He said: “for over five years, we have created an enabling environment for key players to maximise the potential of the leather industry; we are delighted about LLF2023 and look forward to the significant impact it will make in Nigeria and across Africa.” LLF2023 will feature a series of engaging conversations and masterclasses where selected speakers will be available to share insights on relevant and key topics that affect the African leather industry while featuring a well-curated series of workshops for creatives.
