Chairman of the Delta State Chapter of the Niger Delta Youth Council of Nigeria (NDYCN), Omoniyi Freedom, has congratulated Chief Bernard Okumagba on his recent appointment as member representing Delta State on the Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). Omoniyi’s stance on the appointment was contained in a statement on Thursday in Warri, Delta State. Describing his appointment as “well-deserved,” he urged Okumagba to regard his new position as an opportunity to justify the confidence reposed in him by making a lasting impact. The Niger Delta activist, who said he had no doubt that Okumagba would succeed given his antecedents and experience, also enjoined the new appointee to see himself as an ambassador of his fatherland in conduct and performance. Acknowledging that Okumagba’s appointment is a plus for Deltans, Omoniyi said: “This is a greater plus to the voice of reasoning and wisdom by Delta APC under distinguished Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, in favour to the Host Communities of Oil Producing LGAs. Despite all the odds faced by different opposition groups and faces, grace found him back.
