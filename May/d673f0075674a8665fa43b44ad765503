On Friday, reports had emerged claiming that Ez Abde was the only Barcelona loanee that had a chance of staying at the club next season. However, it seems like there has been a major change of stance with regard to the future of Abde as SPORT is now reporting that Barcelona have decided to go ahead with the sale of the 21-year-old Moroccan winger. Abde signed for Barça in 2021, arriving from Hercules CF to strengthen the reserve team, but got an opportunity with the senior squad under Xavi due to injuries. And he made a solid impression in his limited chances. Abde joined CA Osasuna on loan last summer and has made a notable impact during his time with the Pamplona-based side, helping them finish as runners-up in the Copa del Rey. Given his performances, there were calls for the Moroccan international to be integrated into the Barcelona first-team setup for next season. It was claimed that the 21-year-old would participate in the pre-season under Xavi after which a decision on his future would be taken. However, as per the latest reports, Abde’s future now appears to be sealed as the club plan to offload him and are already studying proposals for the young winger. Given that Barcelona are in need of making big sales to generate revenue and the chances of Abde getting a regular run in the side appearing slim, the club see it best to sell him and generate profits rather than loaning him out for another season. Furthermore, the report states that Xavi believes Abde’s performances are still a bit inconsistent and with plans in place to sign Yannick Carrasco, selling him is seen as the right move. POLL The 21-year-old is attracting interest from the Premier League, where Leeds United are willing to pay €40 million for him, and the Bundesliga as well. So, as things stand, Abde could be on his way out of Barcelona permanently in the summer and the sale could even take place before June 30.
