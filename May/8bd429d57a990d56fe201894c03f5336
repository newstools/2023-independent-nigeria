Manchester United have reportedly offered a contract to Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot. The Frenchman, 28, was close to a move to the club last summer after a fee was agreed, before a dispute over wages proved to be a stumbling block. United reportedly offered Rabiot a salary that would have made him one of their higher earners, but still couldn’t reach his demands. Rabiot – who had a short stint in Man City’s youth academy and has also played for PSG – went onto enjoy an impressive campaign in Italy, scoring 11 goals in 44 games which is the most prolific season of his career by far. However, he is out of contract at the end of the season and according to RMC Sport, United have made a provisional offer to the 28-year-old as Erik ten Hag looks to improve his squad for next year. Despite a promising first campaign under the Dutchman, the Red Devils have struggled for depth at times which has contributed to several inconsistent results. The club’s football director, John Murtough, pursued Rabiot aggressively last summer before the move fell through.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He is yet to respond to United’s contract offer, while Max Allegri’s side have also put a proposition on the table to keep him in Turin. POLL His mother and agent Veronique Rabiot – who is a notoriously tough negotiator – is now set to negotiate with the interested parties in the coming days. Elsewhere, United are also reportedly targeting a move for Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder Manu Kone. The Frenchman, 21, broke through with Toulouse before securing a move the German outfit in January 2021. Since moving to the Bundesliga, Kone has impressed and broke into the France Under 21 side. The 21-year-old is contracted until June 2025 and is also being tracked by several top European clubs including PSG.
