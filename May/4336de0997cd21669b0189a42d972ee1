Following his clash over a seat with the other faction of the party at the Appeal Court in Abuja for the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal, the factional leader of the Labour Party, Lamidi Apapa, was booed outside the venue. The opposing LP faction outside the court was screaming, ‘Ole’ (loosely translated as a thief), ‘Imposter’ etc., as Apapa’s supporters led him away from them. It was reported that there was a disagreement between two factions of the party before the court resumed proceedings at the tribunal.
