Beyoncé made her long-awaited return to the stage on Wednesday night, in Stockholm, Sweden. Wednesday’s show in Stockholm kicked off the European leg of the ‘Renaissance World Tour’ which will run through the end of June. After that, the North American leg will begin with two shows in Toronto, and then zig-zag across the United States. The ‘Renaissance World Tour’ is Beyoncé’s first solo tour since 2016’s ‘Formation World Tour’. In 2018, Bey embarked on a joint tour with her husband, JAY-Z, and delivered a memorable headlining performance at Coachella. Most recently, in January the 41-year-old multi-hyphenate played a private concert for a crowd of influencers in Dubai, which reportedly earned her $24 million. The next act opened with a performance of the Renaissance cut “Church Girl,” in which Beyoncé created a stunning visual by using UV lights to transform her choir robe into a stained glass look. She followed up by throwing it all the way back to 2003’s “Crazy in Love” alongside other tracks like “Get Me Bodied” and “Love on Top” — the latter of which she mixed with The Jackson Five’s “I Want You Back.” Returning back to her latest album, Bey ran through the Grammy-nominated “Virgo’s Groove,” “Plastic Off the Sofa,” “Move,” “Heated,” and “Thique.” During the latter track, she interpolated Britney Spears’ “Toxic.” For the final act of the show, she ran through Renaissance standout “America Has a Problem” dressed up as a bee, because, of course. That part of the set even included a news desk for Bey’s “KNTY News.” Before closing out the show with “Summer Renaissance,” she ceded the stage to her dancers, who showed the crowd what ballroom, a major influence of her dance album, is all about.
