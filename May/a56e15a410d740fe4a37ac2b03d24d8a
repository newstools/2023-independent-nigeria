P/HARCOURT â€“ A group known as MoMo Payment Service Bank (MoMo PSB) last week organised a trade launch event in Mile 3 Market, Port Harcourt, Rivers State capital, in commemoration of its one year anniversary. It would be recalled that following the approval of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), MoMo Payment Service Bank (MoMo PSB) was established in 2020. Source reports that the payment bank has grown with over four million users. The event was witnessed by traders at the biggest market in the garden city who trouped out to open MoMo PSB wallets. The accounts would enable the users to make monetary transactions seamlessly using their various types of phones. MoMo PSB agents and MTN staff were at the venue of the launch to guide new users open accounts while some of the agents went round the market opening accounts for other new users. Highlights of the event included a raffle draw for the newly registered users and the first set of winners were: Mr Godson Iwunze, Tunde Egufe and Oluchukwu John. The winners were rewarded with some items, including vegetable oil and noodles. POLL Expressing his delight, Iwunze said with a MoMo PSB wallet, he would be able to make transactions such as payment of cable television subscriptions and transfer of money with ease. On his part, Egufe, who said he had been experincing difficulties in making online payments through his bank, said he would henceforth use MoMo PSB to do so.
