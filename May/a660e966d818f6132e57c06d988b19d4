AWKA – The Police in Anambra State have said that the Chief Security Officer (CSO) of a bank in Ihiala in Anambra State was wounded in the legs when its men in a joint operation with the Army battled agents of suspected Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed wing, Eastern Security Network (ESN) which also at­tempted to rob a bank. A statement signed by the Police Public Relations Officer Ikenga Tochukwu, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) said that an attempted attack on a bank was averted as a result of improvement in security dom­inance and surveillance in the state to enhance safety. According to Ikenga, the joint security forces comprising the Police and Military at 12:30 p.m. on 9/5/2023 dispersed illegal sit-at-home enforcers from the IPOB and ESN in Nkwo Mar­ket, Ihiala. The outlawed group mem­bers armed with guns and oth­er dangerous weapons, he said, came out in their numbers on motorbikes and started shooting sporadically, in an attempt to rob a bank and disrupt commercial activities and vehicular move­ment going on in Ihiala. “The joint operatives re­sponded swiftly which made the armed men abandon their evil plan and took to their heels. Unfortunately, due to the in­discriminate shootings by the armed group, a stray bullet hit the chief security officer CSO of the bank on the leg and he has been taken to the hospital where he is currently receiving treat­ment. No life was lost. “Afterwards calm has re­turned to the area as Police with other security forces have inten­sified patrols, and improved se­curity,” he said.
