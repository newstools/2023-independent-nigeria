The Flying Eagles suffered a 0-2 defeat to the five-time champions Brazil in the U20 World C last group matches. The defeat against Brazil saw them finish as third-best losers in Group D. Brazil, Italy and Nigeria all finished on six points each, but the South Americans won the group courtesy of a superiors goal difference. Italy finished runners-up after they stopped whipping boys the Dominican Republic 3-0 in the other game in the group. Tonightâ€™s loss was the third the Flying Eagles have suffered at the hands of Brazil in this competition. They lost 3-0 at the 1983 edition in Mexico, 2-0 in 1985 and 4-0 at the 1987 tournament. Nigeria will thus now face either the United States of America or hosts Argentina in the Round of 16. The Flying Eagles gave away two goals late in the first half to see them tumble from the top of the group to third place
