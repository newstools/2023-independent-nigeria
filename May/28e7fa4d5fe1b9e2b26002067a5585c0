BENIN  – The Management of Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, Edo State, has sacked no fewer than 13 of its academic and non-academ­ic staff over alleged falsification of age, embezzlement of funds, gross misconduct, extortion and sexual harassment. Prof. Asomwan Adagbonyin, the Acting Vice Chancellor of the University, who revealed this in Benin said the decision to dismiss the erring staff was reached fol­lowing the recommendations of the University Staff Disciplinary Committee (USDC) which found them guilty of the offences. Adagbonyin made the revela­tions while presenting the com­mittee’s report to the Chairman, Engr. Andrew Olotu and mem­bers of the AAU Special Inter­vention Team (SIT) on Monday. The AVC disclosed that the affected staff are from the fac­ulty of Basic Medical Science, Medical Laboratory Sciences, Nursing Department, Engineer­ing Department, Faculty of law, Political Science, as well as the former Director of the Universi­ty’s Farm. He also revealed that the disci­plinary committee had given the affected staff a fair hearing and recommended that “the criminal aspect of the disengaged staff should be reported to security operatives for further action.” Prof. Adagbonyin said a lec­turer who was the head of nurs­ing science was recommended for sack after he was found guilty of extorting students of N32,000 and N52,000 respectively, adding that a lecturer who was indicted for sexual harassment was also dismissed. According to him, “The lec­turer had claimed to only make advances, but he went to the said girl’s church to plead for forgive­ness. The victim has been pro­tected and reassigned to another lecturer.” The Acting Vice Chancellor, however, announced that out of the 209 disciplinary cases re­ceived, the USDC has concluded 132 of the cases, representing 63%, while 77 cases representing 37% are still pending.
