I have been on the best of terms with members of the 6th and 7th assemblies and they will all speak for me that am ready to be the Speaker of the 8th assembly. “I have the zeal to unite and bring people together. To bring peace and progress to Anambra state. I will relate very well with the Governor to maintain cordial relations between the House of Assembly and the Executive arm including the Judiciary. “I am lucky to come back. My constituents have tried a lot to bring me back irrespective of the fact that a lot of people fought against my returning back but then the majority of the people said I have to go back and complete what I have started.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Although Nwafor was cognisant that the leadership of the incoming 8th assembly could only be determined and decided by God, he maintained that he was in good stead for the Speaker of the 8th Anambra State House of Assembly.
