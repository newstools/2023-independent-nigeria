Appreciating the customers in UCH for turning out in large numbers for the forum, the first since its merger, Oliti said, the forum was to sensitise the customers in UCH on the latest development in the pension industry and the immense value proposition Access Pensions has to offer its clients both serving and retired. He maintained that, as the number two PFA on returns on investment for 2022, Access Pensions have put necessary measures in place to serve the customers in UCH better such that it has opened the second branch in Ibadan for them directly opposite the hospital. He enjoined them to remain committed to the company for them to have value for their investment, insisting that with an experienced team of investment professionals with over 100 years of cumulative experience in the financial landscape their investment is in safe hands.
