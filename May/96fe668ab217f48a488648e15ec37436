P/HARCOURT – Nigerian judges, particularly those in the Supreme Court have been advised to work hard to redeem their images which have been dented by the recent judgments in the course of the last general elections in favor of some highly placed mem­bers of the ruling All Progres­sives Congress, APC. A particular mention was made of the former Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Senator Godswill Akpabio and the Sen­ate President, Senator Ahmed Lawan who bought forms for the APC presidential prima­ries and that of the senate at the same time, but were given a clean bill by the Apex Court after they both failed to clinch the presidential ticket. Baring his mind in Port Harcourt, Rivers State in an exclusive interview, the Gen­eral Overseer of the Abundant Live Evangel Mission, ALEM, Apostle Eugene Ogu said Nige­rians lost their respect for the judiciary when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Akpa­bio and Lawan in a clear case of double registration before the elections. Apostle Ogu called on the judiciary to woo back the trust Nigerians had in it by giving the right judgment at all times. “The Supreme Court can gain its respect back from Ni­gerians if they choose to do the right thing, giving the right judgment. There is so much quietness in the land. This qui­etness is abnormal. Nigerians should not be taken for granted for choosing to remain quiet on what is happening in this coun­try, especially the outcome of the last elections, ”he said. The former Rivers State chairman of Pentecostal Fel­lowship of Nigeria, PFN and the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN said it was un­lawful to have sworn-in Pres­ident Bola Ahmed Tinubu as President of Nigeria when the issue of the mandatory 25% was yet to be resolved by the court.
