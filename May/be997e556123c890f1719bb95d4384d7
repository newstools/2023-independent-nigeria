LAGOS – Austin Okere, the Founder of CWG Plc, and the Ausso Leadership Academy, which mentors businesses and entrepreneurs for geometric growth, has called on entrepreneurs, business owners and others not to force their sons, daughters and brothers and sisters to succeed them. Okere, who has an MBA from IESE Business School and is an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Columbia Business School, New York, said only people who are knowledgeable about the business, have passion and are experienced, should succeed the founder. According to him, “If you insist that despite the competent people that are available to run the business after you have exited it had to be your son, or your brother, or sister; then that is where the problem exists because it is going to destroy value in the company and it is going to affect the value of your shares and returns. “In that case, it is better to hire someone who has passion for the business.” According to him, “a company is not owned by anybody; people just have a holding in the shares of the company and that is why they are called shareholders. “The company has a life of its own and because it is innate, its life is lived through the actions of its directors.” He argued that a company is not a kingdom that someone should insist that his son or sister should run or inherit. He posited that the son who is coming in should tick all the boxes – he must be passionate, he must have integrity, he must be competent and he must have character. POLL However, Okere said, “I have seen a lot of businesses; be it law chambers, technology or consultancy firms, where the children have not indicated any interest. But, there is so much pressure to inherit the business and run it. And, in most cases, it dies a slow and painful death…”
