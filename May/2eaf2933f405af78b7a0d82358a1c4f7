The Premier League side have been on the lookout for a new manager since the departure of Antonio Conte in March. They’ve been linked with a number of names, including Xabi Alonso and Julian Nagelsmann but moves for the duo haven’t materialised. Meanwhile, former boss Mauricio Pochettino is on the verge of being announced as Chelsea manager. But Spurs are about to up the ante in their pursuit of the 44-year-old Dutchman, who has also managed Eredivisie side AZ Alkmaar. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has been impressed with the work Slot has done in leading Feyenoord to the Dutch title. The news comes on a day where Spurs suffered another setback in their pursuit of a permanent replacement for Conte, with former Liverpool, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich midfielder Alonso confirming that he would remain in charge of Bayer Leverkusen next season. Spurs have also been linked with former Bayern boss Nagelsmann but talkSPORT understands the highly-rated German is no longer a contender. They were also linked with a move for Brentford boss Thomas Frank. POLL But title-winner Slot could be very appealing to Spurs fans given the club are on a barren 15-year run without a trophy. In his second full season in charge of Feyenoord, Slot has comfortably guided them to glory in the Netherlands with the club wrapping up the title with two matches to spare. Slot, who has earned comparisons with Pep Guardiola, was linked with the Leeds job when Jesse Marsch was sacked earlier this season. Whoever is appointed will be tasked with getting a struggling Spurs side back in contention after what’s been a disappointing season. Meanwhile, there will be plenty of speculation surrounding the future of star player Harry Kane in the summer. The north London side are currently seventh, meaning they’re at serious risk of not even qualifying for next season’s Europa League. Ryan Mason is caretaker manager for the remainder of the season.
