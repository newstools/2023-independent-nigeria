The governor-elect of Abia State, Dr Alex Otti, has asked the people of the state to ignore the ruling of a Federal High Court in Kano State disqualifying his candidature as the governorship candidate of the Labour Party. Addressing a news conference on Thursday, the Media Adviser to Otti, Mr Ferdinand Ekeoma who spoke on behalf of his boss, described the judgment as baseless, unfounded and misleading, pointing out that the judge that delivered the judgment was careful to have avoided issuing an Order to that effect. His word, “For the records, though the perpetrators targeted the Abia Governor-Elect and the people of Abia for that legal coup, they were not courageous enough to confront him in the open, hence he was never joined as a party for fear that his eminently qualified lawyers would take the perpetrators to the cleaners. “To put the records straight and reassure our teeming supporters and millions of Abians who are still celebrating the liberation of Abia, we wish to emphatically state as follows: “To that effect, the court specifically stated in Clause 9 of the judgment ‘The candidates that participated in the election in Abia state are not parties before this court and as such the court lacks the jurisdiction to make an order for the issuance of Certificate of Return to them’. The governor-elect argued that any case filed not later than 23 June 2022 must be determined not later than 180 days from the date of filing, saying “again, assuming it was filed on 23 June of 2022, the 180-day timeline terminated on 20 December, 2022”. POLL He, therefore, assured Abia State indigenes as well as all Nigerians that “the nationally celebrated mandate given to Dr. Alex Otti by the long-suffering Abia masses is safe and secure and can never be stolen by strange usurpers who are pained and frightened by the reality of their imminent exit from power in the next few days”. He declared, “In the next few days, Dr. Alex Otti will be sworn in as governor to enable him to commence the process of rebuilding and recovering our state that was destroyed and plundered by the PDP, so Abians are enjoined to ignore the FAKE REPORT claiming that he has been sacked by a High Court in Kano”.
