AWKA  – Emmanuel Nwafor, the law­maker representing Orum­ba-south State Constituency in the outgoing 7th Legisla­ture of Anambra State, has outlined cogent reasons he wants to become the Speaker of the incoming 8th Assembly. Nwafor, who won his first term election on the plat­form of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), has also been re-elected for a second term to consolidate on the gains of his first out­ing in the Legislature. This time, the very profi­cient and prolific lawmaker says he is interested in the Speakership of the 8th As­sembly having garnered the knowledge, competence and capacity for the said office. Speaking exclusively with our correspondent at the state Assembly complex in Awka, Anambra State capital, the lawmaker said, “I am ready to take the man­tle of leadership to be the Speaker of the 8th Assembly. “It is not a new thing to me. I have gathered enough experience. I have been a leader in so many organi­sations. I have been on the best of terms with members of the 6th and 7th Assembly and they will all speak for me that I am ready to be the Speaker of the 8th Assembly. “I have the zeal to unite and bring people together; to bring peace and progress to Anambra State. I will relate very well with the governor to maintain cordial rela­tions between the House of Assembly and the Executive arm, including the Judiciary. ‘I am lucky to come back. My constituents have tried a lot to bring me back irre­spective of the fact that a lot of people fought against my return, but then the majori­ty of the people said I have to go back and complete what I have started.” Although Nwafor was cognisant that the leader­ship of the incoming 8th As­sembly could only be deter­mined and decided by God, he maintained that he was in good stead for the Speak­er of the 8th Anambra State House of Assembly.
