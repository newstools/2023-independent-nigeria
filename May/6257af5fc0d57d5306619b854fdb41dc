According to 90min, West Ham United are eyeing moves for City stars Kyle Walker and Kalvin Phillips when the transfer window opens. The report claims that the Hammers are hoping to sign Phillips, who has struggled to make an impact during his first season with City. The 27-year-old joined the reigning Premier League champions from Leeds last summer, but has made just 17 appearances across all competitions so far this term. Towards the end of last year Phillips suffered a shoulder injury that sidelined him for two months, but he has failed to force his way into the starting line up since returning to full fitness. It has previously been reported that Phillips is considering his future at City after what has already been a disappointing campaign individually for the ex-Leeds man. Walker, meanwhile, has been a regular for City for a number of seasons now. The England international joined City from rivals Tottenham Hotspur back in 2017 and has since made more than 245 appearances for the club. In that time he has lifted 11 trophies, including four Premier League titles and four League Cups. POLL Walker has remained a regular for Guardiolaâ€™s side this season, making 31 appearances across all competitions so far. Despite that, it appears that West Ham are hoping to sign the right-back this summer as they look to bolster their squad ahead of next season.
