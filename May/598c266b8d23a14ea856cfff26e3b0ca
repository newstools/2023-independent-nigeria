Seven decomposing corpses have been found in the Gidan Makeri Forest of Kagarko Chiefdom, Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State. A source told Daily Post that, “the decomposing corpses are suspected to be those of bandits’ informants, the corpses were discovered by teenagers who went to rear cows on Sunday afternoon.” He said it was difficult to identify the bodies as they were already decomposing. He, however, said after inquiry, it was established that the remains are those of bandit informants shot dead by troops while they were escaping arrest.
