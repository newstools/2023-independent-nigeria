ABUJA – A former Minister in the outgo­ing administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, Comrade Solomon Dalung, has urged Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to stabilize Nigeria by constitut­ing a government of National Unity (GNU). Dalung who served as Minister of Sports and Youth Development during the first fours of the administration,in an interview said the incoming administration should priori­tize the unity and stability of the country. Dalung said the 2023 presi­dential election has done harm to the unity of the country and said the incoming government should avoid reveling in victory as there was no such thing in the February 25 poll. Describing the election as the worst election experience of his entire adult life the Pla­teau State born politician said that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) connived with rogue elements of different political parties to declare preconceived results. “Personally, I hate being asked to evaluate the 2023 elec­tion because it is the worst electoral experience I have seen in my entire adult life. I was dragged into politics when I was in form 2 in secondary school, in 1978 by my mentor, late Chief Solomon Lar. And I have been in it even though I went into the security services. I didn’t detach myself from it even though I paid dearly as a result. I’ve consistently been ei­ther an active or passive moni­tor of the political evolution of Nigeria since 1978. “First, the ballot paper of the 2023 election was of the lowest quality ever. My knowledge of a ballot paper is that it was like a cheque. It took me time to be able to identify the logo of polit­ical parties”
