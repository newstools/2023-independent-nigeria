OWERRI – The Imo State Government has explained that it has no plan to abolish mixed schools in the state but would rather establish more technical schools and to promote academic competition among male and female students. The Commissioner for Education, Professor Johncliff Nwadike, who gave the clarification said that the state government would soon employ at least 10,000 primary school teachers and extend same to post-primary schools, adding that principals had been directed to reintroduce inter-house sports competitions in their schools to promote athletic competitions among students. He assured that education is free in all schools in the state. Nwadike who disclosed this to newsmen in his office while speaking on the activities of his ministry, said that the state government would equally establish more special schools for the physically challenged individuals, equip them with modern teaching and learning facilities and also establish more adult education centres. Nwadike, who frowned at the proliferation of private schools in the state in violation of government standard guidelines for the establishment of such schools, said that a clamp down on the schools would soon commence as, according to him, they are business centres intent to make profits. “Before you establish a school, you must meet the official requirements but some of the people they present as teachers are fake and quacks and again, I have discovered that some of the taskforce put in place to checkmate them usually compromise and I quickly stepped them down”. The professor of history and international studies added that the government had commenced measures to clear roads/streets in the state of hawking by school children during school hours even as he blamed some parents for the unhealthy trend. Apart from sustaining the government’s “School Feeding Programme” to spare the children of hunger while in schools, Nwadike said that the government has plans to approach the World Bank for assistance to weed the children off the streets during school hours. POLL “Some of these children are illegal migrants and they constitute serious nuisance to the state and make the public uncomfortable”
