Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta has apologised over the loss of his team to Brighton, 3-0 at the Emirate Stadium. The loss means Arsenal are four points behind leaders Manchester City and have just two games remaining. Pep Guardiola’s side knows a win against Chelsea at the Etihad next Sunday means the title will be theirs again. “We have to apologise for the performance in the second half. It was not acceptable.” “Mathematically, it’s still possible but now it’s impossible to think about it. We need to digest the result and the performance in the second half, understand why and have a different reaction,”said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta. Arsenal had been the better side in the first half as ex-Brighton forward Leandro Trossard hit the bar, but Julio Enciso gave the Seagulls the lead six minutes into the second half and the Gunners got progressively worse as they realised their chances of staying in the title race were rapidly diminishing. Substitute Deniz Undav pounced on a deflected clearance four minutes from time to put victory out of Arsenal’s reach before Pervis Estupinan rubbed salt in the wound deep in stoppage time. By then, many Arsenal fans had left, crushed that the one glimmer of hope of winning their first Premier League title since 2004 was all but extinguished.
