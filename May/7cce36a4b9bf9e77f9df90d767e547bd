As Nigerians look forward to the swearing-in of a new president, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on May 29th, a group called Greater Oyo State Forum on Thursday appealed to the president-elect to rally notable leaders and stakeholders that worked for the actualization of his electoral victory in the Pacesetter State for a meeting ahead of the inauguration day. The group emphasized that such a meeting would allow the leaders to pay their homage to the new president because there hasn’t been any such ‘congratulatory visit’ to the Asiwaju since February when he won at the poll. According to the group, such a visit would engender mutual trust among the people of the State and the President-elect because they are already worried that the state has not been properly represented, notwithstanding the visit of G5 Governors to the President-elect, where Governor Seyi Makinde of the State also featured prominently. Drawing an inference from other Southwest States where key stakeholders had visited the President-elect, the group said the deaths of its prominent leaders, especially two former Governors and first-class Royal Fathers, shouldn’t be an excuse not to have other pro-Tinubu leaders making it to Abuja on a congratulatory visit. The new president won on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Makinde, though a Peoples’ Democratic Party member surreptitiously supported Tinubu of APC to win all the 33 local governments during the recently held presidential election of 2023.
