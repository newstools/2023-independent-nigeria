LAGOS – A facility maintenance expert, Engineer Afolai Adedeji , has 0again reiterated the need to imbibe the culture of facility maintenance in order to stop ‘ our important edifices from decaying’. He gave the advice in an interview with Daily Independent. According to him, the absence of this culture of maintaining our cherished monuments have continued to be the bane of building development. He said: “We are quick to erect very fine structures but very slow at maintaining these important edifices which over time, becomes desolate. When you go the nation’s capital, you find very attractive buildings but after a while, they begin to fade because they lack proper maintenance. Adedeji, a Fellow of the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) hinted, that unless we cultivate the culture of taking care of our facilities, we will just continue to waste our limited resources on frivolous projects that will not stand the test of time.
