The 63rd Annual General Con­ference (AGC) of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) sched­uled to hold from 25th of August to the 1st of September 2023 in Abuja will be hosting 20,000 del­egates from across the county. The annual conference which is said to be among the largest gatherings around the world is themed: “Getting It Right – Charting the Course for Nigeria’s Nation Building”. Speaking on the plans for the conference, the Chairman, NBA AGCPC 2023, Mazi Afam Osigwe, SAN, stated that the NBA leadership is pleased and to be leading honoured at the privilege of leading eminent colleagues from across the branches, to plan and deliver what we hope will be another excellent gathering. He said: “As you are un­doubtedly aware, the Annual General Conference (AGC) is the leading annual event of the NBA and a staple on the calendar of the Nigerian legal profession. Each year, we come together to discuss, debate and learn; constantly seeking new ways to improve the practice of our profession, how we ser­vice our clients, and the way our society is governed and regulated. “The first quarter of this year saw the conduct of argu­ably the most contentious elec­tion cycle in our recent history and the first since the passing of the amended Electoral Act. Lawyers have been front and centre of the pre and post-elec­tion activity that has dominated our national discourse for the last several months and there will certainly be a lot to exam­ine at the conference. “At the time of launching this website, a President-elect is waiting to take over the reins of office; in-coming and re-elect­ed Governors in states where elections were conducted are either waiting in the wings or planning for the next four years, and members of national and State Houses of Assembly are no less keen to take office.”
