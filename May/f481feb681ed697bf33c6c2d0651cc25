Nigeria recorded earnings of $1.345 billion from the export of about 167 products in the same quarter. Dr. Ezra Yakusak, the Executive Director, Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC), said that Ninety-Seven Countries, spread among five continents of the world, imported Nigerian products during the period under review. “The top five countries that imported from Nigeria are Brazil, China, Japan, India and the Netherlands. Regrettably, no African country made the top 10 non-oil export destinations. We believe that the full implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) will change this Trade trajectory,” he stated. Yakusaksaid that during “the period under review, 658 companies participated in the export of various products. The Director-General said this in Abuja, while presenting the first quarter progress report on non-oil performance for 2023 at a press briefing.

According to him, “A total number of 167 products were exported in the 1st quarter of 2023, these products range from manufactured, semi-processed, solid minerals and raw agricultural commodities. “Just like last year, the first quarter also shows that Nigerian products are gradually shifting from its traditional export of raw agricultural commodities to the export of semi-processed and manufactured goods.” While giving a breakdown of the top-ten products exported in the first quarter of 2023, Mr Yakusak stated that Urea, Cocoa Beans, Sesame Seed, Soya Beans/meal and Cashew nuts/ kernels were among the top five. “A total of 618,184.06 metric tonnes of products worth 75.829 million dollars were exported to 12 ECOWAS countries in the period under review.
