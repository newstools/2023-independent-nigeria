The CEO of MTN Nigeria, Karl Toriola, received the 2023 SABRE Africa Certificate of Excellence as CEO of the Year in recognition of his tenacious leadership and drive for innovation. Since becoming CEO of the leading technology giant in October 2020, Toriola has spearheaded the organisation’s transition from solely providing telecommunications services to a wide range of technology solutions. During his time in office, MTN Nigeria became the first company in Nigeria to receive the licensing to roll out 5G spectrum commercially. MTN Nigeria was also granted a Payment Service Bank licence to provide financial solutions to Nigerians through MoMo PSB, the fintech subsidiary of MTN Nigeria. Another milestone for MTN Nigeria during his time as the CEO was the successful closure of the Public Offer. In December 2021, MTN Nigeria became the first Nigerian company to make its public offer of 575 million sales in shares to retail investors through a premiere digital platform during the Primary Offer. With Toriola as CEO of MTN Nigeria, its revenue doubled from N1 trillion in 2018 to N2 trillion at the end of the financial year in 2022 as the organisation also under his wing achieved its most substantial growth in 2021 and 2022 at 22.9 percent, and 21.6 percent respectively. When asked to speak about his greatest accomplishments as CEO of MTN Nigeria in a recent exclusive interview, he said: “First of all, it’s a team accomplishment. So, it’s not down to me but the entire team – from the board, right down to everyone working in the organisation. But I think getting MTN Nigeria back to a place where it’s being liked and loved gradually is probably my biggest achievement. It’s a long journey.
