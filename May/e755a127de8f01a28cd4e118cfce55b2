Victor Osimhen, Lautaro Martinez and André Onana are reported to be on Chelsea’s radars for the summer, but new coach Mauricio Pochettino also seems willing to give a chance to Romelu Lukaku. Pochettino has reached an agreement with Chelsea and according to The Guardian, he will soon sign a three-year deal with the Blues. The former Tottenham and PSG coach has a clear plan to rebuild the squad in 2023-24 and according to the report, Napoli star Victor Osimhen is his main target to bolster Chelsea’s attack. However, Inter‘s Lautaro Martinez is also on the Blues’ radars, while his teammate André Onana is an option in goal. La Gazzetta dello Sport reported earlier this month that Pochettino is willing to give a chance to Lukaku, who will return from his loan spell at Inter in June. However, it remains to be seen if the Belgian wants to stay at Stamford Bridge and if Inter will try to bring him back to the club on loan in 2023-24.
