ABUJA  – Senator Ahmad Lawan, the President of the Senate, has commended Nigerian journalists for making im­mense contributions to the socio-political and economic development of Nigeria. He said that “Nigerian journalists deserve our ap­preciation for their contri­butions to democracy and governance in general in Nigeria as the Fourth Estate of the realm”. He said this in commem­oration of the World Press Freedom Day, adding that “Promoting press freedom is not only upholding the rights of an important seg­ment of the society, it is also promoting the human right to freedom of speech and opinion. “It is in the light of this that the ninth National As­sembly has ensured in the past four years that no leg­islation under its purview tampers with these rights”.
