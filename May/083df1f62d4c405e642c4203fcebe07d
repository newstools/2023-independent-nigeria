East Africa’s rapidly burgeoning tech scene is undergoing a transformative shift, thanks to a surge of innovative startups pioneering industry-wide changes. However, the region still grapples with an acute shortage of skilled developers, a challenge that Ethiopian entrepreneurs Amadou Daffe and Hiruy Amanuel are combating head-on with their startup, Gebeya. Founded in 2016, Gebeya’s mission is reminiscent of Andela’s but with a distinctive Addis Ababa flair. Gebeya’s core objective is to foster a robust talent ecosystem, training and connecting pre-vetted tech talents with African businesses, thereby accelerating the region’s digital economy. Recent studies by Google indicate that Africa is home to an estimated 716,000 developers, with more than half concentrated in Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, and South Africa. Despite an incremental growth of 3.8% from preceding years, the African developer pool still lags considerably behind its counterparts in the US, Europe, and Asia. Embodying its name ‘Gebeya’ — ‘marketplace’ in Amharic — the startup has played a pivotal role in addressing this talent gap. Initially launched in Ethiopia, Gebeya has progressively expanded its geographical reach, offering services across Africa and beyond. “We envision Gebeya as more than just a marketplace,” explains Amadou Daffe, co-founder and CEO. “Our mission is to drive the digital economy of East Africa forward by cultivating a sustainable and scalable talent ecosystem.” In its journey, Gebeya has made strategic moves to bolster its talent pool. In 2018, the company acquired US-based software and consulting firm Coders4Africa (C4A), further expanding its reach. By the end of 2022, Gebeya’s commitment to excellence and innovation was recognized when Daffe was listed among the top ten finalists for Africa Business Heroes.
