Liverpool and Aston Villa go head-to-head, with both sides looking to secure European foot­ball for next season today at 3pm. The Premier League is fast approaching the home straight, and there’s still plenty to play for at both ends of the table. For Liverpool and Aston Vil­la, though, focus is on the top end of the spectrum, with the former looking to push Manchester Unit­ed all the way in the top-four race and the latter still dreaming of achieving a top-seven finish. Jurgen Klopp’s men have endured a mixed-bag campaign, and would have written off Champions League football alto­gether at one stage. But a recent purple patch of nine unbeaten games — including seven wins on the bounce — coupled with slip-ups from their top-four ri­vals has just left the door ajar in the race for a seat at Europe’s premier competition. A 3-0 win over Leicester City in midweek closed the gap to ri­vals Manchester United to just one point, with Mohamed Salah turning provider and assisted all three goals. Unai Emery meanwhile, is looking to gatecrash the top sev­en and potentially sneak either a Europa League or Europa Con­ference League position. It’s a situation world’s apart from when he first walked into the club back in November. In such a short space of time he has transformed the Villans from relegation fodder, to European chasers. Despite Villa’s upturn in for­tune they have suffered a recent drought in the final third, firing blanks in each of their last two games. In fact, Emery’s men have scored the fewest goals of any team in the top half of the table this campaign (46). POLL When you consider that Liv­erpool have kept the second-most clean sheets this season (13), then Klopp should be feeling pretty good about producing another shutout against the travelling Midlanders. Although, Ollie Watkins has scored more Premier League goals against Liverpool than he has against any other opponent (5), so their main focus will be keeping the England forward quiet this afternoon.
