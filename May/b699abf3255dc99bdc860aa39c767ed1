Mercedes-Benz has unveiled the first full-electric model from its Maybach ultraluxury sub-brand, the EQS Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV), as Mercedes emphasises sales of high-end models. The Mercedes-Maybach EQS SUV debuts at the Shanghai auto show, recently. China accounts for about half of all Maybach sales, Mercedes said. The car is a reworked version of the Mercedes EQS SUV with more luxurious materials. It will join Maybach versions of the S-Class sedan and GLS large SUV. “We are completely redefining the SUV luxury of the future,” Ola Kallenius Mercedes, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) said in a statement. Mercedes sold 23,400 Maybach models last year, up 41 per cent from the year before. In the first quarter of this year, the group’s top-end segment, which includes AMG, Maybach and G-Class models, grew by 18 per cent, reaching 91,800 units for the period. Overall group sales were up by just 3 per cent. Other luxury brands are planning or launching their first full-electric vehicles. The Rolls- Royce Spectre coupe will debut late this year. Bentley says it will launch its first EV in 2026. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The Maybach version of EQS SUV will be built alongside the regular EQS at Mercedes’ U.S. plant in Vance, Alabama. POLL It has a redesigned grille that lays the sub-brand’s signature vertical chrome-plated stripes over a solid black surface. A light strip runs above the grille the incorporates a chrome plate with the Maybach name across it. The car is available with 21-inch or 22-inch alloy and forged wheels exclusive to the model. Two-tone paint scheme is standard. Mercedes did not announce prices. The dashboard uses the EQS’s three-screen layout, including one for the passenger, but overlays Maybach-specific start-up animations. The appearance of the screens can be customised with three display styles – Discreet, Sporty, and Maybach. The surrounds for the instruments are in rose gold.
