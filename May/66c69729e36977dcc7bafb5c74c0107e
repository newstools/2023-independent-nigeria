A bill seeking to create a National Centre for Christian Education to regulate and set standards for the practice of Christianity in Nigeria has passed the second reading in the Senate. The bill was sponsored by Senator Binos Yaroe, representing Adamawa South Senatorial District. In his presentation, the federal lawmaker said the bill, when passed would properly, “strengthen religion as a source of strength and national solidarity, which is why the bill to establish the centre to create a curriculum for Christian education is very necessary.” Yaroe claimed that the centre, when established, would aid in resolving the country’s “inappropriate practice” of religion, which according to him, had in the past, led to issues. Weighing in on the discussion, Senator Istifanus Gyang of the Plateau North Senatorial District, argued that improperly practised religion has fostered radicalism. Gyang noted that religion could be a source of strength and national solidarity if followed properly, adding that the bill, when established, will create a curriculum for Christian education. Sen. Abba Moro, representing Benue South in the Red Chamber, said the bill was ‘apt’ given that some youngsters had been duped by radical religious figures.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
