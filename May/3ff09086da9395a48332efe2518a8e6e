ABUJA – The Labour Party (LP) on Monday said that its doors remain open to those vying for principal positions in the National Assembly. The party’s remarks came in the wake of reports that it was in bed with lawmakers from the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) who are seeking to be elected as principal officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Recall Friday last week, suspended former National Publicity Secretary, Abayomi Arabambi, had accused the National Chairman, Julius Abure, and some party officials of entertaining APC lawmakers at the expense of the party. But National Secretary of the LP, Umar Farouk, on Monday at the party’s Secretariat debunked Arabambi’s allegation, insisting rather that the Labour Party was poised to provide better welfare for Nigerians. According to him, to achieve this, “we will partner with those willing to partner with us. But our lawmakers at the National Assembly will continue to give us updates on developments there”. Farouk made the disclosure at a world press conference ahead of a one-day summit for all its elected candidates organized by the LP Diaspora wing. Speaking at the conference, the Summit’s Media Committee Chairman, Yunusa Tanko, said that the conference would focus on impactful leadership and good governance, building synergies for the new Nigeria of our dream, law-making, constitution and democracy, among others. He added that the gathering would enable the party to brief its legislators and governor-elect on the brand of politics that is people’s oriented.
