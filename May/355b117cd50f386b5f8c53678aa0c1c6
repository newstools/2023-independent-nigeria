ABUJA – The Department of State Services (DSS) on Thursday said that it is aware of plans by subversive elements to dis­rupt the May 29 handing over programmes in parts of the country. Peter Afunanya, Public Re­lations Officer, DSS, said this in a statement made available to Daily Independent. The President-elect, Vice President-elect, Governors-elect and Deputy Governors-elect will be sworn in on May 29 in Abuja and in most of the states. Afunanya said the aim of those planning to disrupt the May 29 inauguration is to un­dermine security agencies’ efforts at ensuring peaceful ceremonies as well as creating panic and fear among members of the public. To this end, he advised citi­zens, the media and civil society organisations (CSOs) to adhere strictly to security and civil pro­tocols during the events. The statement also urged them to shun fake news, false alarms, skewed reportage/nar­ratives and sensationalism that may likely inflame division, ten­sion and violence prior to and after the exercises. “This is more so that such undesirable acts will serve no purpose other than destroying national unity and cohesion. Additionally, all unauthorised (and unaccredited) persons are warned to stay away from restricted and certain designat­ed areas at the event venues. “The Service reiterates its earlier call for the populace to remain calm and law abiding. Meanwhile, it will continue to sustain collaboration with sister agencies to ensure suc­cessful inaugurations”, the statement read.
