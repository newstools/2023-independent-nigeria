Alexander Lukashenko, the President of Belarus, on Tuesday, May 2, called a meeting to discuss pressing issues relating to the country’s security and law enforcement. He claimed that the situation around Belarus remained “difficult” with “NATO’s military potential gathering near the borders”. “We could not postpone this meeting, the situation forces us to react to the situation that is developing,” Lukashenko said. During the meeting, he instructed the government and security units to prepare considerable new measures to safeguard the state border from saboteurs entering the territory of Belarus. “Recently, such cases have become more frequent. Therefore, I would like to hear comprehensive proposals on counteraction,” he added. Ivan Tertel, the chairman of the State Security Committee, shared intelligence data that predicts a significant deterioration of the operational situation developing around Belarus.
