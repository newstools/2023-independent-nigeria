LOKOJA  – Some stakeholders of the Peo­ples Democratic party (PDP) on Wednesday restated their com­mitment towards ensuring that power is shifted to the west sen­atorial district in the November 11, 2023 governorship election in Kogi State. To this end, candidates on dif­ferent political parties from the eastern district and west zone of the state have been advised to step down for the candidate of the PDP, Senator Dino Melaye, from the west for equity, fairness and justice in the distribution of power in the state. This was the submission of critical stakeholders of PDP from the 21 local government councils of the state who converge on Lokoja, the state capital, to unveil the candidate of the PDP, Senator Melaye, to the public. State chairman of the PDP, Engineer Sam Ohuotu, while presenting the party’s flag to the standard bearer, Melaye, urged those who participated in the primary election to show spirit of sportsmanship and join hands with the party to cruise home vic­tory at the forthcoming governor­ship election. The chairman noted that once again, the November 11, 2023 gov­ernorship election would present an opportunity for the party to free the state from the clutches of poverty, underdevelopment and misery that pervaded the entire fabric of Kogi in the last eight years of the APC administration in the state.
