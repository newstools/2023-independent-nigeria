Oyo State Governor , Seyi Makinde, has declared that he is poorer by 10 percent in his first term as governor of the state. Makinde made the dec­laration on Sunday while speaking with newsmen in Ibadan. He said he submitted his asset declaration form at the Code of Conduct Bureau of­fice, situated on State Secre­tariat, Total Garden Road, on Friday in Ibadan. It could be recalled that Makinde, on the assumption of office in 2019, declared N48 billion worth of assets. Makinde, who did not make known details of his as­sets, however, said the details would be made known to the public later. In compliance with Para­graph 11 Part 1 to the Fifth Schedule of the 1999 Constitu­tion of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, a governor is mandat­ed to declare his assets at the end of the first tenure. “By law, I have to do dec­laration of assets at the end of my first tenure and before assuming office for the next tenure. “So, I have gone to the CCB Office to submit my assets dec­laration form at the end of my first tenure and also my assets at the beginning of the second tenure.You are all aware of my assets declaration for the first tenure. I can tell you that in the last four years, I’ve been poorer by 10 to 12 percent. POLL “This is because I have not really had the chance to look after my business. We have been looking after Oyo State business. So, I’m not surprised that there were a bit here and there, but I’m still okay”.
