AKURE – The Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, on Sun­day described the eight years’ gov­ernment of President Muham­madu Buhari as hell. He said that Nigerians would not forget in a hurry what they went through under the admin­istration of Buhari’s adminis­tration. Speaking about Buhari, whose administration terminat­ed midnight on Sunday, the cleric told his congregants that “Nige­rians would forever internalize Buhari’s name just like the late General Sani Abacha’s name.” He, therefore, called on Nigeri­ans to pray for the President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, so that the situation will not be like moving from frying pan to fire. Giwa said: “We must not move out of a house infested with ants into one infested with rats. Nige­rians must pray and cry to God for Divine mercy. “It’s only God that can turn the negative situation to a posi­tive one. It is not an understate­ment to say that Nigerians went through hell under President Buhari’s eight years’ tenure
