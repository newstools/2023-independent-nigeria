The Agbekoya Society of Ni­geria, a socio-political group in the Southwest and the parental body of Agbekoya Farmers As­sociation, has condemned the recent attacks on the facilities of the Federal Radio Corpo­ration of Nigeria, FRCN, in Ibadan by the suspected mem­bers of Oodua Nation agitators. Recall that in the early hours of Sunday, a group of individu­als suspected to be agitators of Oodua Nation took control of Radio Nigeria Amuludun FM, located in Moniya, Ibadan, the capital of Oyo State. According to reports, ap­proximately twenty individu­als carrying various charms forcefully entered the station at around 5:30 AM. They seized control of the live studio while a sponsored program was in progress and proceeded to broadcast their own program. During their broadcast, they made several claims, including statements such as “Oodua Na­tion has come to stay,” “Yoruba people are no longer under the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” and “The United Nations will soon recognise Oodua Nation.” The unauthorised broadcast lasted for about an hour until a combined team of police, op­eration burst, and the Nigerian Army arrived at the scene. They successfully regained control of the station, appre­hending five suspects in the process. The suspects were subsequently taken to the Oyo State Police Headquarters in Eleyele, Ibadan for further questioning. The General Manager of the station, Mr. Stephen Agba­je, confirmed the incident and stated that security operatives had restored normalcy to the premises. POLL Reacting to the ugly inci­dent, the Secretary General of the group, Dr Adegbenro Ogunlana, who distanced the society from the actions said the criminal gangs were pri­marily funded and sponsored by unscrupulous politicians to demonise the integrity of the Yoruba clans. “We have no relationship whatsoever with the group that has repeatedly engaged in crime and we have no hands in their criminal conduct,” he said.
