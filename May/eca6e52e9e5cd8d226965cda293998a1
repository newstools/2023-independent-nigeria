Paris Saint-Germain forward, Lionel Messi, has apologised to the club and his teammates after he was suspended for travelling to Saudi Arabia. The PUNCH reports on Tuesday that Messi was suspended for two weeks over the unauthorised visit to Saudi Arabia. The Argentina star has responded to the backlash by apologising to the club and his teammates, saying that he thought he had a day off and was unable to cancel the trip. He said, “I thought we were going to have a day off after the game as always happened. I had this trip organised and I couldn’t cancel it. “I had already cancelled it before. I apologise to my teammates and I’m waiting for what the club wants to do with me.”
