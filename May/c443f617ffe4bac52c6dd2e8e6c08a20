ABAKALIKI  – A rights group in Ebonyi State, Ebonyi First Vanguard, has charged the in-coming administration in the state to ignore the demand of mischief makers for arbitrary partitioning of the war-torn Effium community in Ohaukwu Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. The group noted that Effium war arose from attempts to frustrate the operation of the Nigerian constitution in the community in order to reduce majority of the people to second class citizens; and not about ownership of any parcel of land or property. The director-general of the group, Mr. Monday Eze, who disclosed while addressing Journalists pointed out that the template of arbitrary partitioning had failed in Ezillo and charged the incoming administration to make the peace and security of the state a cardinal priority by upholding the Nigerian constitution to accord full constitutional rights to every citizen of Ebonyi State including people of Effium community. Mr Eze also urged the incoming to support Federal Government’s efforts to return peace to the war-ravaged Effium community by blocking the routes of war mercenaries at the boundaries of the community and releasing and implementing the report of the judicial panel of inquiry on Effium crises which was submitted to Ebonyi State Government since August 2021. Ebonyi First Vanguard, according to Mr Eze is concerned that the war foisted on Effium community since January 2021 had turned to a guerilla warfare in which mercenaries are recruited from different parts of the country to attack refugee camps in Effium and kill women, children and other vulnerable groups. Our correspondent reports that the Effium communal war which has lasted for two years has claimed thousands of lives and property worth billions of naira.
