The National Secretary of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association (MACBAN), Alhaji Bello Aliyu Gotomo has decried the way and manner Nigerian security agents arrests and illegally detain Fulani across the country without coherent reason for the arrest and detention in various nation’s custodial centers . He noted that quite a number of Fulanis have been arrested and remanded in prison custody without being tried “Security agencies should arrest criminals not because one is a Fulani, in every tribe there are criminals and that has nothing to do with their religion or tribe therefore criminals should be arrested and prosecuted. Bello explained that arbitrary arrest and detention provoke crime saying a local vigilante group known as “Yan sa Kai in Kebbi State has been arresting and killing Fulanis on unfounded allegations thereby escalating crimes and aggravating crimes by people unlawfully arrested or killed by them so security agents must fish them out for justice to be done. He urged the media to stop labeling Fulanis as bandits saying rural banditry involves other tribes not Fulanis alone because real Fulanis are cattle breeders who move around for greener pastures, not for violence. He appeal to the federal government to rebuild cattle ranches in the country heavily encroached by constructing earth dams and put in place facilities like milk collection, and veterinary hospital centers across the country as it is a viable business that can sustain the economy of the nation because trillion litres of milk are being wasted in the country. Noting that milk collection and production would save the country from depending on foreign milk which is not as safe as ours.
