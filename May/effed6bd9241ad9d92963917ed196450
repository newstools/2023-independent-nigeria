LAGOS  – The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), has warned that the 2023 Fiscal Policy Measures recently released by Federal government will send negative signals to the business community locally and internationally with implications for existing and potential investors. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, Director General of MAN, told Daily Independent that the policy will reduced production volumes with its attendant result on downward trend in capacity utilization He said:” We would like to put on record that the real impact on our members in the industries under excise regime from the 2022 fiscal policy has been negative and this has reduced production volumes with its attendant result on downward trend in capacity utilization, increased illicit trade in some of the affected products, erosion of members’ market share and revenue, especially following continued devaluation of the Naira against major currencies” He noted that the policy will squeeze margins as our members are unable to pass additional costs to consumers by way of higher prices given their eroded income and dwindling purchasing power. “Apart from the above challenges faced in the business environment, manufacturers also have to contend with currency devaluation and increasing inflation resulting in higher cost of production as our members have little to no access to foreign exchange at the official window and have to resort to the parallel market at an extra cost of around N300 to US$1.00 “All these are without regard to the industry’s contribution to the Nigerian economy in the way of significant taxes being paid (Excise, Corporate Income Tax, Value Added Tax – VAT, , export revenue in foreign currency; employment of thousands of Nigerians by the industry directly and indirectly including supply chain partners in the SME sector as well as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to the local communities and other stakeholders nationwide” He specifically said: “It is worrisome that the current situation is indicative of inconsistency in Government policy, given that industries that are affected by excise tax administration, already made 3-year strategic plans based on the agreed calendar as scheduled in the roadmap including domestic and export sales prices, revenue and volume projections, tax burden calculations, ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “This in our opinion, may create credibility issues for the country with existing and potential investors, impacting Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) and the country’s Ease of Doing Business index among other implications. POLL “It is therefore, alarming and concerning that the implementation of the 2022 to 2024 approved excise roadmap, as contained in the 2022 Fiscal Policy (which commenced on 1st June 2022) has unfortunately not even been implemented for up to one year, before Government decides to ‘shift the goal post.”
