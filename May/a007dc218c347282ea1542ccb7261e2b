With Sergio Busquets set to bid goodbye to FC Barcelona in a little over a month, the club are hard at work to find a suitable replacement for the 34-year-old veteran. Busquets’ current contract with the Catalan giants expires on June 30 and he has confirmed that he will be leaving when it does. A decision on his next club is yet to be made, although Saudi Arabia appears to be the most likely destination. Busquets’ departure is set to leave a gaping hole in the middle of the park at Barcelona. Despite being 34, the midfielder was a key element of Xavi Hernandez’s setup and it will be difficult for the club to find a like-for-like replacement. As such, journalist Gerard Romero is reporting that Barça are looking at six possible options as potential replacements for their departing captain. However, the name of Bayern Munich superstar Joshua Kimmich is no longer on that list. Kimmich had been heavily linked with a move to Barcelona over the past week or so. However, it seems like the 28-year-old German international is no longer among the priorities at Spotify Camp Nou. Instead, Barça are looking at six other players as possible replacements to take over from Busquets next season. It is well-established at this point that Xavi is keen on Real Sociedad’s Martin Zubimendi even though his €60 million release clause poses a challenge. And he continues to remain the priority for the Blaugrana as per Romero. Other names such as Sofyan Amrabat and Ruben Neves have been linked with a move to Barcelona while there is also interest in Uruguayan youngster Fabricio Diaz. It remains to be seen if any of these players are among the six names that Barça are considering at the moment. POLL For now, what is clear is that Kimmich is no longer an option while Zubimendi continues to remain the top priority.
