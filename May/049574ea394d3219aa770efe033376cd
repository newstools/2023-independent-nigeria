LAGOS â€“ Former Lagos State chairman of the Labour Party, Comrade Olukayode Salako, has unveiled a new political association, Passion Alliance Forum (PANFO). The association has representatives and supporters across the 20 Local Government Areas (LGAs) and the 37 Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) in Lagos State, even as the group noted that all the members of the group were members of the Labour Party and that more members of the party will join them later. Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Salako who is the founder and chairman of the association was also a special adviser to the national chairman of the Labour Party, Julius Abure. Salako in his address stated that he voluntarily resigned as a member of the Labour Party and that he had to leave the party out of persecution because his wife, Daramola Kayode Sakako is a committed member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and for their claim that he was a mole of the APC and Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. He noted that the association is a 35-man state executive committee (Exco), and stressed that the ethics and culture of the Labour Party are worse than those of their contemporaries, like APC, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) etcetera, and that the association will be run as a party driven by passion. He said that Labour Party which has condemned other political parties has failed to organise itself and wondered how Labour Party which has failed to organise itself can lead the country which they have clamoured unsuccessfully to lead. PANFO leader said that his objective for calling the conference, which by divine agenda is the newest organic political organisation in Lagos State and its core values are capacity, character competence and social charisma which they have gathered to actualise. He said that they will run the political association differently and will not run the mini political party as they have seen in other political parties that they have complained of, having led the Labour party to win Lagos State in the 2023 presidential election, as the chairman of Labour Party, a feat that has never been achieved by any political party in 24 years.
