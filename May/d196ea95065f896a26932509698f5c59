LAGOS  – The Flying Eagles have been warned to be careful against Argentina on Wednesday in the Round of 16 of the ongoing FIFA U-20 World Cup. Giving the warning on Monday, former Team Man­ager of defunct Julius Berger FC, Engr. Mactony Taiwo, said the warning became necessary, as the Flying Eagles would be playing against many factors. “They really need to be very careful as they will be play­ing against many factors on Wednesday,” he began. “Playing the host at this stage of any competition is not always good and the on­going U20 World Cup is not an exception. “They should just take the match like every other match­es they have played and feel threatened that they are play­ing the host. “Secondly, they should also not look at the record that they are playing one of the most suc­cessful teams in the Under-20 World Cup. “Such was the main reason they lost to Brazil with two quick goals within five min­utes. “My take is that they should play out their hearts and be de­termined, focused with assur­ances that millions of Nigeri­ans are praying and supporting them to succeed in the competi­tion,” Taiwo said. POLL After placing third in their Group D of the competition behind Brazil and Italy on Saturday, Nigeria qualified for the Round of 16 as one of the Best Third placed teams in the group stage and will be taking on host, Argentina in one of the Round of 16 matches on Wednesday. Leader, Brazil will take on another African representa­tive Tunisia, while Italy takes on England.
