IBADAN – The Niger Delta Rights Advo­cates (NDRA) has asked the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the incoming members of the National Assembly to con­sider integrity, loyalty and hard work in arriving at their choice of the leadership of the 10th Na­tional Assembly. The group, which said it is a ‘political pressure group and foremost advocacy group on rights of Niger Delta indigenous people’, in a statement on Friday said its interest in intervening in the debate on the leadership of the coming National Assembly was because of proper leader­ship and inclusiveness. In the statement signed by its National Coordinator, Bright Ngolo, NDRA said “the choice of leadership of the National As­sembly should not be left to the ruling elite but that citizens and indeed the electorate must have to debate the strengths and weak­nesses of the dramatis personae vis-a-vis the performance of the current and past leaderships of the NASS. “We do believe and rightly so that it remains a moral burden for the nation to consider the in­clusion of the South-East zone to the leadership matrix of the nation and the formation of the leadership of the 10th National Assembly presents an auspi­cious opportunity to us all.” It said the decision of the lead­ership of the APC to present the post of Deputy Speaker to the South-East zone was welcome and added that the zone has qualified sons and daughters at the House of Representatives especially those of the APC extraction. Since it is only one person that would occupy the position, NDRA said it was throwing its weight behind Mr. Benjamin Kalu representing Bendel Fed­eral Constituency to become the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, saying Kalu had the capacity considering the number of bills which he has to his credit, among other factors including visibility.
