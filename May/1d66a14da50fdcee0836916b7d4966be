The Anambra Police Command has an­nounced the rescue of the two abducted vic­tims of the US convoy attack along the Atani-Osamela Road in Ogbaru Local Government Area of Anambra State. The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Tochukwu Ikenga, in a statement announcing the rescue, said the operation was carried out by the joint securi­ty force comprising the Police, the Military, the DSS and other agencies. He, however, did not give de­tails of the rescue but simply said the victims were rescued today, May 19, 2023, unhurt while investigations were on. DSP Ikenga had on Wednes­day informed that the man­hunt for the fleeing assailants who carried out the dastardly act and set the corpses of the deceased and their vehicles ablaze had begun adding. “The joint security forces have embarked on a rescue/ recovery operation in Ogbaru LGA, following an attack on a convoy of staff of U.S. Con­sulate today by 3:30 p.m. along Atani, Osamale Road. “The hoodlums murdered two of the security operatives, and two staff of the Consulate, and set their bodies ablaze and their vehicles. Also, the arson­ist/murderers on sighting the responding joint security forc­es abducted two Police opera­tives, the driver of the second vehicle and took to their heels. No US citizen was in the convoy. “The command, while react­ing to the situation regretted that a convoy of such or any related would enter the state without recourse to the police in the area or any security agency assured that the battle against the insurgents in the state is focused and would re­main sustained until such a time security stability is fully restored,” the police said.
