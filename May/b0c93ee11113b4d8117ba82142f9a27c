LAGOS  – The Senior Pastor of Christ Living Spring Apostolic Ministry, Pastor Wole Oladiyun, has said, “the assured help anyone, family and nation need can only come from the Almighty God. According to him, “the help of man can fail, but the help of God does not fail.” Pastor Oladiyun stated this at the annual convention of Mount Zion Foundation Ministries, Ajuwon, Ogun State. While lamenting current state of the nation, Oladiyun said, “We’ve seen turbulence in Nigeria for the past 16 to 20 years, we’ve seen crisis here and there, that includes kidnapping, lawlessness; the rulers are misleading and the followers are not following well with the youths crying, when will their time come?” Berating the three tiers of government for lackadaisical approach to governance, Oladiyun said, “We see misrule in Nigeria, our Commonwealth being thrown here and there. The three tiers of government, the federal, the State and the local government are not doing well. “Equally, with the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, things are lopsided because there is disorderliness in the country and the only way this disorderliness can be curtailed is by the spiritual weapon we are wielding. “Because, it is the only help of God that can straighten the situation in Nigeria.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He said that the majority of civil servants are corrupt and are living above their wages. POLL “If the government’s Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) can get things done right, the level of corruption will be very low. The ministries, departments and agencies are more corrupt than the politicians.” He maintained that while still in the service, someone in the civil service will be stupendously wealthy, and you begin to wonder, with questions, how much does the person earn monthly? “How did the person come about the wealth and what other things the person does that brought such wealth?” On the way forward, he called for the revamping of local government administration.
