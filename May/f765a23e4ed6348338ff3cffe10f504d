ABUJA – The leadership of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) has been asked to put measures in place to protect the party from the influence of a former Zamfara State governor, Abdulaziz Yari. The ruling party was warned against backing Yari’s ambition to be the President of the Senate for the tenth National Assembly, as the APC was urged not to forget in a hurry the implosion caused within its ranks when the former Zamfara Chief Executive was the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF). This is APC Chieftain and social critic, Dr Garus Gololo, who condemned moves by Yari to disobey the party’s zoning arrangement for principal offices in the Senate, by insisting on contesting for the President of the Upper Chamber. Gololo, while speaking with our Correspondent in Abuja on Saturday, said that as a “loyal party man, I am compelled to lend my voice to the crisis considering the havoc brought on the APC by Yari’s previous antics. It is obvious that he is at it again. I pray that this time, the party is quick, up and doing to prevent this type of person from infiltrating our ranks. He has shown what he is capable of doing, and we must not allow him to succeed at it”. He explained that “Yari’s inordinate ambition is capable of causing rift within the party, especially seeing that we have chosen where to move to as far as the Senate presidency is concerned”. The ruling party Chieftain called on other APC members nationwide to give their support to Senator Godswill Akpabio, the party’s choice for the role, adding that “it is only by closing ranks with our national leaders that we can build a united party that is able to translate its manifesto to the wishes, dreams and plans of Nigerians”.
