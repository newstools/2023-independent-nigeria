The former Liverpool player, Xabi Alonso, has been linked with the vacant managerial position at Tottenham Hotspur. Since retiring from playing, Alonso has coached Real Sociedad B and is now the manager at Bayer Leverkusen. According to the De Telegraaf, Alonso is the leading candidate for the job ahead of Feyenoord coach Arne Slot. Although he is not the most experienced manager, Alonso does have a very good record at Leverkusen. In 22 games he has won 13, drawn four and lost five. Alonso has also guided the German side into the semi-finals of the Europa League, where they will face AS Roma. Alonso has experience in English soccer as a player, with Liverpool he made 210 appearances. He won the Champions League and the FA Cup with the Reds. Julian Nagelsmann was an early favourite for the job but the Telegraph has reported that “Tottenham’s talks with Julian Nagelsmann have hit a stumbling block over the uncertainty surrounding the sporting director role to work with the next managerial appointment.”
