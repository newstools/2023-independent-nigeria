ABUJA – Usman Alkali Baba, the In­spector General of Police (IGP), has appealed to the outgoing National Assembly to expedite action and pass the bill seeking the establishment of all police training institu­tions in the country. Baba said that the passing of the bill would provide a legal and operational frame­work for the institutions. Baba who was speaking during a stakeholders’ en­gagement, organised by the joint Senate and House of Representatives Committee on Police Affairs on Wednes­day in Abuja, said enactment of the bill would streamline the police training to be in tune with international best practices. He explained that the exec­utive instruments currently before the parliament were products of the police reform committee, domiciled in the office of the Chief of Staff to the President, stressing that training was an essential part of operations of the police, and so could not be over-em­phasised. “You need training to move from one rank to another. Some need specialised train­ing in order to function well. If you want to be in the mobile unit, you need training, and if you want to be a detective, you also need training,” he said. Earlier, Speaker Femi Gba­jabiamila, represented by Idu­ma Igariwe, the Deputy Chair­man of the Committee on Appropriation, who declares the event open, described the engagement as “a very im­portant assignment, both for the police and Nigeria. Gbajabiamila added that if the legal framework was in place, it would help in better funding of the institutions. Haliru Jika, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Po­lice Affairs, and his House’s counterpart, Usman Bello Kumo, in their separate re­marks, pledged speedy pas­sage of the bill before the par­liament winds down.
