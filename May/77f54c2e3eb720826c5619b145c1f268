ABUJA  – The Federal Medical Centre Abuja, has joined the world over to commemorate this year’s hand washing day. Chairperson of the FMC Abuja, Infection, Prevention and Control Committee, Dr. Chinyere Nkoli Umezuoke, said the World Health Organisation set aside May 5, every year to mark World Hand Hygiene Day. Addressing clinical and non-clinical staff of the hospital, Dr. Umezuoke said the commit­tee is observing the day by sen­sitising the hospital staff and creating awareness of the need to maintain personal hygiene by effective and regular washing of the hands. “Diseases transit and spread from one person to another, and this underscores the need for health workers to wash their hands before and after coming in contact with patients,” she said. The medical personnel ex­plained that hand washing is in two forms: “washing one’s hands with running water or Veronica bucket; or use of alcohol-based hand wash, popularly called sa­nitiser. These two forms, she said, help reduce the weight of trans­mission within the hospital set­ting when people do not wash their hands or use sanitisers. Dr. Umezuoke disclosed that statistically, hand washing reduces the transmission of disease by the range of 50 to 68 percent. “Hand washing reduces the transmission of pathogens, that is, micro-organisms that cause disease,” she said. POLL She stated that evident-based research has shown that hand washing reduces mortality, morbidity, hospital stay and saves life. As part of activities marking this year’s event, the FMC Infec­tion, Prevention Control Com­mittee further embarked on an advocacy and sensitisation visit to the Government Secondary School, Kuchigoro, FCT. With the theme, “Acceler­ate Action Together….. Clean Hands Save Lives”, students of the school were educated on the best global practices of washing hands.
