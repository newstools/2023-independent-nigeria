Organised by Broadcast­ing Organisations of Nigeria (BON), TNBA is aimed at recognising and rewarding excellence in the broadcast media industry. In his opening address at the ceremony, BON Chair­man and Chief Executive Of­ficer of MultiChoice Nigeria, John Ugbe, said the awards attest to BON’s commitment to continuous improvement of standards in the broadcast profession. “As an organisation, BON’s vision is to foster a future-proof environment for radio, TV and new media broadcasters to serve their audiences and contribute to the development of our so­ciety. We consider it equally important to reward excel­lence and project the Nigerian broadcasting industry as one committed to the continual improvement of standards. Through these awards, we commit to shining the spot­light on exceptional talent, and seeing to it that those de­serving are duly recognised and celebrated. “I must say that the pool from which tonight’s winners will emerge is impressive. This is an attestation to the fine crop of professionals we have in the industry. I would like to extend hearty congrat­ulations to all the nominees tonight. Being nominated is a testament to your profession­alism and contributions to the broadcasting profession in Ni­geria and, in my book, you are all winners,” Ugbe said.
