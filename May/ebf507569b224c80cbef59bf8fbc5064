Vegetable is very important source of vitamins and minerals that forms an essential source of the human diet. There is no much difference between vegetable farming and other types of farming. The only little difference is the duration of cultivation and maturity. Depending on the variety planted, vegetables take very short time to mature, compared to other crops.

POLL You can make over 100 percent turnovers on this investment in watemelon alone every three months. Pepper, the general one and the green one used in making salad and all sorts of things. Pepper is planted and harvested within three months, attracting considerable profit in the market. Pepper is always selling in the market – because almost everybody eats pepper. Okro sells fast and we have two times for planting it – March and September and it runs through three months for rain fed farming. The September period, which is the late season, is the best planting season, as it can raise farmers up, if done in a very large space. Ugu is another fast selling vegetable and I think this is because it is used by all the tribes in Nigeria people compared to other kinds of vegetables.

While you can’t use it during the dry season because you would need to be applying water every day because of the fact that it drains water easily. Another soil is the clay soil.
