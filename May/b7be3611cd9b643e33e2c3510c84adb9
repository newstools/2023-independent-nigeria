The Minister of State For Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, has reacted after the Supreme Court dismissed the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)’s suit challenging the alleged double Nomination of the vice president-elect, Kashim Shettima. The suit by the PDP and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, was seeking Tinubu and Shettima’s disqualification from the poll over the alleged double nomination. The opposition party claimed the act violated the electoral laws. The appellant anchored its appeal on the claims that the appellate court erred in law when it dismissed its appeal and affirmed the judgment of a trial court that held that the suit was incompetent and lacking in merit. However, the Apex court in its judgment on Friday agreed with the lower courts that the PDP lacks the locus standi to institute the case. Reacting to this, Keyamo in a post shared on Twitter said, “Law is devoid of sentiments. There was no case in the first place. We will continue to educate them”
