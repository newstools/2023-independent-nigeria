Messi has since issued a public apology, explaining that he thought the players had the day off. Now, PSG have shared an image of the 35-year-old back in training one week after the incident. Messi was not expected to train during his two-week suspension and this suggests his employers have lifted the ban in light of his apology. The seven-time Ballon d’Or winner was banished from training all of last week, docked wages, and missed the 3-1 victory over Troyes on Sunday. It is understood PSG players were set to be granted a day off if they beat Lorient last Sunday but manager Christophe Galtier called them in after a surprise defeat. Explaining the situation, Messi said: “Hello, well, I wanted to make this video after everything that is happening. “First of all, I apologise to my teammates, to the club. Honestly, I thought we were going to have a day off after the game, as had been happening in previous weeks. “I had this trip to Arabia organised and I couldn’t cancel it. I had already cancelled it before. POLL “I repeat again and apologise for what I did. Here I am, waiting for what the club decides.” Messi is expected to leave Paris at the end of the season when his contract expires. He has been linked with a return to Barcelona or a lucrative move to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal.
