P/HARCOURT – The Chairman of Emohua Local Government Area, Dr. Chidi Lloyd, has dragged the Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company (PHED) to court over breach of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) reached between Emohua Local Government Council and the PHED for the restoration of electricity in the LGA. Hearing of the matter at the State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt was stalled due to the absence of the defendant (PHED) Dr. Chidi Lloyd had instituted a N5,000,0000,0000 suit against the PHED for breach of contract to restore electricity in Emohua LGA after paying over N24,000,000 being the council’s part of the funds required for the restoration of electricity in the MoU entered with PHED in December 2022, for which the PHED has failed to carry out. The Presiding Judge, Hon Justice, S.H Aprioku ordered the counsel to Dr. Chidi Lloyd and the Emohua LG Council to issue hearing notice to the defendant and adjourned the matter to 30th May, 2023. The adjournment was as a result of the absence of the defendant (PHED) and their lawyers in court when the matter was mentioned. It would be recalled that Dr. Chidi Lloyd had in line with his administration’s commitment to reposition the LGA for rapid development approved the restoration of electricity in the area after months of power outage occasioned by the activities of criminals who vandalised the electricity line from Ahoada transmission station to Emohua LGA, and a memorandum of understanding (MoU) entered with the management of PHED. PHED had during the signing of the MoU assured that electricity was going to be restored in the LGA before the end of 2022; they specifically promised to ensure that the people of the area celebrated the 2022 yuletide with uninterrupted power supply but failed to keep to their promise and their own part of the agreement, after receiving the Local Government’s own part of the MoU.
