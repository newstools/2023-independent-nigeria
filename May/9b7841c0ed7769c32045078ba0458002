As part of its contribution towards women’s socio- eco­nomic development in the country, Henkel Nigeria, manufacturers of consum­er products, has launched a platform where issues affecting women are being discussed. Speaking at the launch of the platform tagged ‘Iya Hen­ry’, transformation manager at Henkel Nigeria, Chidera Akwuba, said the stand would afford women the opportunity to discuss busi­ness, health and wellness, finance, relationship and motherhood, among others. Akwuba further ex­plained that her organisation remained committed to the advancement of the welfare of women and girls in the so­ciety, adding that her compa­ny’s advocacy on women de­velopment aligned with the 2023 International Women Day (IWD0 theme, ‘DigitALL: innovation and technology for gender equality’, “At Henkel Nigeria, we are passionate about women. We want to see them thrive and achieve great feats. In our dynamic world today, women have more opportunities to excel, and we are, therefore, glad for the establishment of ‘Iya Henry’, which provides a safe space for women to live up to their full potential,” she said. Akwuba noted that one of the cornerstones of Henkel’s global company culture is the incorporation of diversi­ty, equity and inclusion (DEI) in its operations. According to her, Hen­kel was one of the first German-stock listed com­panies to establish a dedi­cated global diversity team, adding that the company has established a wide DEI network involving women, who work collaboratively across all departments and regions where it is opera­tional. The company, she said, is keen on its commitments to ensure that it is a more diverse, equitable and in­clusive organisation, as it has taken it up as its social responsibility to mirror the gender parity of the glob­al population and provide equal access to opportuni­ties.
