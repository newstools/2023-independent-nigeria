Foremost telecom regulator on the continent, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and Internet Exchange Point of Nigeria (IXPN) are thudding support for the 2023 Nigeria DigitalSENSE Africa Forum (NDSF) series on Inter­net Governance for Develop­ment (IG4D) slated for Thurs­day, June 8, in Lagos. Disclosing this at the week­end, the Lead Consulting Strat­egist, DigitalSENSE Africa and Group Executive Editor, ITREALMS Media, Mr. Rem­my Nweke said that this year’s NDSF comes with the theme: 5G: Data Governance, Safety and Security. This, he said, has become important due to the recent licensing of Fifth Generation (5G) in the country, just as ex­perts will be lined up to address various subthemes during the forum. Plans, Nweke said, are in top gear to ensure the forum held at the prestigious Welcome Cen­tre Hotels, along the Murtala Mohammed International Air­port Road, Lagos is successful. NDSF series on IG4D, he said, is hosted by DigitalSENSE Africa, an At-Large Structure (ALS) certified by the Inter­net Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), in collaboration with the Nige­rian Communications Com­mission (NCC) together with top industry stakeholders like the Internet Exchange Point of Nigeria (IXPN), among others. As said by Nweke, the 2023 NDSF series on IG4D will open for registration by 9 am and is the free entrance as it comes at no charge to the par­ticipants. He recalled that NCC is the apex regulatory authority for the telecommunications industry in Nigeria and was created under Decree number 75 by the Federal Military Gov­ernment of Nigeria on 24 No­vember 1992, with the mandate under the Nigerian Commu­nications Act 2003, to properly carry out its regulatory func­tions and activities, including but not limited to consulting with consumers, commercial and industrial organizations; delegating its functions to a Committee constituted by it, summoning persons to ap­pear before the Commission, establishing and maintaining subsidiaries to enable the dis­charge of its functions, licens­ing to name a few.
