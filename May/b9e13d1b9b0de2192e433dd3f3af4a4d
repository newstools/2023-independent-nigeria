LAGOS  – The Managing Director/CEO, Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) Mr Ahmed Lawan Kuru has reminded stakeholders to view the agency’s recovery mandate as one of serious national importance in the federal republic of Nigeria. Kuru made the call at the weekend in two separate engagements with AMCON external solicitors, and receivers as well as Asset Management Partners (AMPs) in Lagos. He said the call has again become important because AMCON is not set up to operate in perpetuity as the Corporation has a sunset period thus the need to apply speed in the collective recovery assignment. The AMCON CEO, who was represented at the interactive sessions by Mr Benedict Daminabo, the Group Head, Asset Management Directorate in the Corporation, said if at sunset AMCON is unable to recover the huge debt, which currently stands at over N4trillion, it becomes the debt of the Federal Government of Nigeria, which he said would have huge implication on the taxpayers’ monies. As a result, he said the positive debt recovery history of AMCON cannot be fully told by chroniclers of financial and economic history in Nigeria without some critical stakeholders such as AMCON Solicitors and indeed the entire Nigeria judiciary as well as Receivers; and the Asset Management Partners (AMPs) that have become major tools in the recovery efforts of AMCON. He described the engagement, which is AMCON’s first major interaction with stakeholders in 2023 in Lagos as very important, and strategic to the recovery efforts of AMCON. “We (AMCON), value our relationship with all our stakeholders, and we will continue to interact, share experiences and brainstorm on the best ways for the Corporation to succeed in this national assignment. Feedbacks received from interactions with our various stakeholders’ overtime, and particularly from Judges from the various Courts necessitate continuous training and retraining of our stakeholders especially as it relates to challenges encountered during filling processes in Court and enforcing AMCON’s rights on obligors’ assets. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
