Makinde, while assenting to the amendment of the bill at the Executive Council Chamber in Ibadan, commended the lawmakers for their timely passage, as it would help the traditional council function well and forestall constant litigation. According to him, “Well, the implication is that we must have a law in the state that allows the smooth running of the traditional council, which is important. Before I came in, the traditional council was not functioning, but now they can function. “You remember that the previous administration tried to reform the traditional council system, especially in Ibadanland. “The government gave coronets to some high chiefs. One of the High Chiefs went to court, and the state court decided that the previous administration didn’t follow their own law. Now that we have amended the law, we will follow our own law, and no one can go to court now and succeed.”
