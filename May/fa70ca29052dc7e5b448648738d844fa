Nigerian and Napoli forward, Victor Osimhen, has broken George Weah’s record for the highest African goalscorer in Serie A history. The Nigerian achieved the feat after scoring from the spot in Napoli’s 1-0 victory over Fiorentina in Sunday’s Serie A fixture. The goal, which is his 23rd this season, is his 47th Serie A goal, edging out Weah (46 goals) to become the highest African goalscorer in the Italian top flight. Osimhen missed a penalty in the 48th minute before finally beating Fiorentina goalkeeper, Pietro Terracciano at the second time of asking in the 74th minute. He has also extended his record for the Most Goals Scored by an African Player in a Single Serie A Season which he achieved after netting a scudetto-sealing equaliser for the Azzurri in their 1-1 draw against Udinese on Thursday which helped Napoli clinched their first Serie A title in 33 years.
