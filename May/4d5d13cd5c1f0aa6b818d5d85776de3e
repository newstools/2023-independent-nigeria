Infinix has launched its latest flagship device- the Note 30 series, at an event themed: ‘Take Charge 24/7’, where it demonstrated its dedication to its fans by inviting over 100 brand faithfuls, who were treated to a sensational performance by their brand ambassador and Nigeria’s top artist, Davido. During the launch event, guests had the opportunity to experience the various Note 30 variants, test the cameras, take selfies, and explore the all-round fast charging features. They interacted with representatives, asking questions and gaining insights into the device. Mr. Benjamin Jiang, the Co-Founder and Infinix Global Head, while speaking at the launch, said: “The Note 30 Series is designed with cutting-edge all-round FastCharge technology that supports multiple charging methods, including wired fast charging, wireless charging, reverse charging, bypass charging, PD 3.0 protocol, intelligent charging, and safe charging across multiple dimensions.” Mr. Opeyemi Adewunmi, the Marketing Manager, Infinix Nigeria, while giving details of its features, said the bypass charging was designed to supply power directly to the motherboard without going through the battery, thus effectively reducing the phone’s temperature and extending battery life.
