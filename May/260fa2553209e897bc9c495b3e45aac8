It has not been long since Inaki Pena has extended his contract at Barcelona. The new deal will see him remain at Camp Nou until 2026, which served as a major boost for the club. Pena deserves a lot of credit for his commitment to the Barcelona side, even after failing to receive regular opportunities and serving as the perennial number two to Marc-Andre ter Stegen. He was recently given an opportunity to start against Real Valladolid this past midweek, as Xavi wanted to preserve ter Stegen’s Zamora statistics. It is possible Pena might start again when Barcelona take on RCD Mallorca this evening. Heading into this game, the young goalkeeper reiterated his desire to remain at Camp Nou for many years and give everything for the club. “I want to stay in Barcelona for many years, I am willing to do everything the club needs and asks of me, I will always accept all decisions made with me,” he said (h/t Miquel Blazquez). A product of the famed La Masia youth academy, Pena has featured in only four competitive matches since being promoted to the senior side in early 2022. He did, however, spend a brief period on loan at Galatasaray, featuring in eight competitive matches. Although the 24-year-old certainly lacks experience at the highest level of football, he has been rated highly in the Barcelona camp for his talent and immense potential. For the time being, Pena may have to continue playing second fiddle to ter Stegen. But should the German get injured at any point next season, Pena should be an excellent alternative for coach Xavi Hernandez and co.
