ENUGU – The Governor-elect of Enugu State, Dr. Peter Mbah, has de­clared his assets to the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB), saying it is obligatory for every public officer to do so as required by law. Mbah, who personally visit­ed the South East Zonal Office of the CCB in Enugu, where he submitted his assets decla­ration forms, said the exercise was critical in the promotion of transparency and accountabili­ty in governance. Speaking to journalists after submitting the forms to the Fed­eral Commissioner in charge of the South East Zone of the CCB, Benedict Umeano, the Gover­nor-elect said: “As the Chief Ex­ecutive, we are meant to uphold the law. It is also incumbent on us to act lawfully, and what we have simply done here today is in line with the new direction of my career. “As you also know, I am now migrating from the corporate environment to the public sec­tor; and in the private sector, we have Codes of Corporate Gov­ernance and here in the public sector, we also have the Code of Conduct for the public servants. “What we have simply done today is to comply with the re­quirements of the law by filling the forms as stipulated by law. The process is quite seamless and we have populated the forms, and we have also, in the presence of a Notary Public, executed the law as required.”
