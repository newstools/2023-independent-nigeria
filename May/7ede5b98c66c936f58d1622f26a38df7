ABUJA  – Despite complaints of prolif­eration of universities in Ni­geria, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting pre­sided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has approved the licensing of 37 new uni­versities in the country. Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, revealed the information after the extra-or­dinary Council meeting on Monday. He noted that the devel­opment brings to 72 the total number of universities li­censed by the Buhari admin­istration since 2015. He failed to name the uni­versities, but revealed that one of them is an online uni­versity, the first of its kind in Nigeria, and owned by a wom­an from Bauchi State, with ex­pectation that it will cater for the likes of northern Muslim women who feel reluctant or are restrained from attending physical campus education. Fielding questions on the expediency of additional universities given funding challenges of the existing ones, Adamu explained that these ones are all private, with enough funds to run them and they should not be denied the opportunity to exist. The minister further ex­plained that Nigeria actual­ly needs more universities as the available ones are not adequate to take up all those yearning for higher educa­tion.
