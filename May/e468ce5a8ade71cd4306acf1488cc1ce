Barcelona are reportedly set to secure the signing of Wolves captain Ruben Neves ‘in the coming days’. Xavi is eager to make additions to his squad and Neves has been heavily linked with a departure from Molineux. According to AS, an agreement has been reached between all parties over a transfer and a deal could happen for £26million. The report states that Xavi has some reservations about the 26-year-old, with the deal having been orchestrated by Barcelona president Joan Laporta and Neves’ agent Jorge Mendes. It is anticipated that if Neves joins then it will lead to fellow midfielder Franck Kessie leaving Barcelona after just one season at the club. Neves made what could be his final appearance for Wolves when he featured as a substitute in their 5-0 defeat to Arsenal on Sunday. The Portugal international joined Wolves in 2017 having started his career at Porto. Neves has made 253 appearances for Wolves, scoring 30 goals and initially played for the club in the Championship before their promotion to the Premier League in 2018. POLL As well as Neves, Barcelona have also been linked with a move for Ilkay Gundogan, who is nearing the end of his contract at Manchester City. Experienced centre-back Inigo Martinez is close to the end of his deal at Athletic Bilbao, and there continues to be speculation regarding a possible return to Barcelona for PSG star Lionel Messi.
