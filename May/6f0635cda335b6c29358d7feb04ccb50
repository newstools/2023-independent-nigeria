ISAAC ASABOR There is no denying the fact that the prices of most staple food items have increased to the extent of becoming unaffordable for not a few consumers. The Nigeria Bureau of Statistics (NBS), recently updated consumers on the unprecedented rates of rising food inflation and said the rate in April 2023 was 24.61 percent on a year-on-year basis, which was 6.24 percent points higher than the rate recorded in April 2022 (18.37 percent). The Bureau, said the rise in food inflation was caused by increases in prices of oil and fat, bread and cereals, fish, potatoes, yam and other tubers, fruits, meat, vegetable, and spirits. “On a month-on-month basis, the food inflation rate in April 2023 was 2.13 percent; this was 0.06 percent points higher compared to the rate recorded in March 2023 (2.07 percent). “The average annual rate of food inflation for the twelve months ending April 2023 over the previous twelve months average was 23.22 percent, which was a 4.35 percent point’s increase from the average annual rate of change recorded in April 2022 (18.88 percent),” it said. The report added that the core inflation, which excludes the prices of volatile agricultural produce, stood at 20.14 percent in April 2023 on a year-on-year basis, up by 5.96 percent compared to the 14.18 percent recorded in April 2022. It said the highest increases were recorded in gas prices, passenger transport by air, liquid fuel, vehicle spare parts, fuels, and lubricants for personal transport equipment, medical services, and passenger transport by road. POLL “On a month-on-month basis, the Core inflation rate was 1.46 percent in April 2023. It stood at 1.84 percent in March 2023, down by 0.38 percent. “The average twelve months annual inflation rate was 17.91 percent for the twelve months ending April 2023; this was 4.23 percent points higher than the 13.68 percent recorded in April 2022,” it said. Against the foregoing backdrop, not a few analysts and watchers in the Nigerian Consumer sector were of the view that Naira scarcity, movement restrictions imposed during the country’s general elections, and high transportation costs triggered the prevailing surge in food prices. While giving a breakdown of its survey on the factors behind the surge in food prices, Vendease, a Nigerian food procurement startup show that the price of a 5kg basmati rice increased by 29.4 percent to N46,200 in mid-March from N35,700 in January and the price for 50kg premium tomatoes rose by 22.2 percent to N24, 200 from N19, 800. It explained that the cost of a full basket of tomatoes (50kg) was N37,400 from N35,200, sweet potatoes rose by 9.1 percent to N26, 400 and 100-110kg of egusi rose by 12 percent to N308,000. “The limited supply of cash owing to the naira redesign policy, as market suppliers were demanding extra charges for payments received via bank transfers, due to movement restrictions to the general elections, food supply trucks could not travel from the north were responsible for the price increases,” it said. It said another factor that contributed to the general increase in prices across product categories was the general increment in utility and fuel prices. “This practically affected the general prices of goods and services.” According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), food prices rose for the second straight month to 24.35 percent in February from 24.32 percent in the previous month. “The contributions of items on a class basis to the increase in the headline index are presented thus: bread and cereal (21.67 percent), actual and imputed rent (7.74 percent), potatoes, yam and other tubers (6.06 percent), vegetable (5.44 percent) and meat (4.78 percent),” the statistical agency said. The higher food prices also led to an increase in the country’s headline inflation rate for the second straight month in February as it rose to a 17-year high of 21.91 percent from 21.82 percent in January, according to NBS. It is expedient to add that Daily Independent through a random survey carried across markets in Ogba/Agege/Berger axis in Lagos shows that prices are spiraling with each passing day, particularly Since COVID-19 began to ease off. As gathered from markets within the axis, prices of diverse foodstuffs cut across Rice (50kg bag) which sells at N14, 500 – N17, 500, Rice (25kg bag) which sells from N7,000 – N9,000, Rice (10kg bag) which sells for N2,500 – N3,000 and Rice (5kg bag) which from N1,200 to N1,600. Similarly, Oloyin Beans (50kg) sell from N30,000 to N39,000 (depending on location and market), Oloyin (25kg) sells at N15,000 to N19,000, Olotun (50kg) sells from N29,000 to N36,000, Olotun (25kg) sells from N14,000 to N17,500, Butter Beans (50kg) sells at N33,000, Butter Beans (25kg) sells at N16,500, White Beans (50kg) sells for N32,000 and Brown Beans (50kg) sells for N32,000. As for yam, Abuja Yam (Large) sells between N700 – N900, Abuja Yam (Medium) sells from N500 to N650, Regular Yam (Large) sells from N500 to N800 and Regular Yam (Medium) sells from N350 to N500. Daily Independent found that other food items have had their prices increase by about N500, depending on the market and the bargaining power of the consumer. The situation, according to some traders, who shared their views on the staggered parleys, the market situation is not likely to change unless there is a significant improvement in the security situation across farms, particularly in the northern part of the country, and improvements in other factors that trigger the prices of foods. Some traders say until there is a level of normalcy in the security situation across farms in the country, consumers would have to live with the price hike. Besides, they pointed out that there is a need to finish selling items stocked during the period prices of food items were purchased by them as they cannot sell below purchase prices of stocked foodstuff in their shops, and added that with that not a few consumers would heave a sigh of relief. This means that Nigerians may have to tighten their belts, as the situation is not likely to abate any time soon. However, Mr. Chris Iwuchukwu, an economist and businessman said with the hike in interest rate to 18.5% a few days ago by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) that there is hope for a decrease in the prices of foodstuffs across markets as rising inflation is the reason why prices of food items are becoming unaffordable. He expressed optimism that the tightening of monetary policy could help to curb inflation, which has been driven by elevated food prices in the country, and added that the increase in the interest rate could help to stabilise the economy in the long run, making it easier for small businesses and SMEs to plan for the future.
