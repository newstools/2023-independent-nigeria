The National Population Commission (NPC) said the 2023 Population and Housing Census was postponed due to the government’s tran­sition programme and the post-election mood in the country. Dr. Inuwa Jalingo, the 2023 Census Manager and Director, National Popula­tion Commission (NPC), said this at a news confer­ence in Abuja on Sunday. Jalingo, who asserted the preparedness of the commis­sion for the 2023 census, said that the NPC had prepared the ground for the first-ever digital census in Nigeria. He said that the commis­sion had achieved top most success in all ramifications in terms of the preparation. “We achieved the interna­tional standard for a digital census. About 450,000 digital gadgets were procured and distributed to all the local governments,” he said. Jalingo said, however, that government was a con­tinuous process, hoping that the incoming administra­tion would build on the suc­cesses recorded for the even­tual conduct of the census. The Census Manager lauded the Buhari-led ad­ministration for its support, saying that the commission had successfully trained about 60,000 facilitators across the country.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “Any one saying we are not prepared must be say­ing that out of ignorance,” he said. POLL Jalingo reiterated the benefits of the census which were not unconnected with national economic planning and the provision of data for administrative planning. He said that the commis­sion was able to mobilise Ni­gerians for the census with every information required for a successful census. The NPC had postponed the Population and Housing Census earlier scheduled from May 3 to May 7 indef­initely.
