The alumni of the Yaba College of Technology, old Secondary School, Lagos, are set to embark on a homecoming. The defunct school produced and moulded thousands of people, who are accomplished in many areas of life. Over the years, the alumni have demonstrated high regard and commitment to the development of the secondary school, which has built a reputa­tion as the parent College, opened in 1947 as Nigeria’s first higher in­stitution. Speaking about the planned homecoming, spokesperson for the alumni, Lawrence Daria, said their members would continue to give back to society despite the odds. The alumni include main­ly those within the country and others in the diaspora, especially those who concluded their stud­ies in the school between 1969 and 1973 who are well experienced in business, civil service, manufac­turing and entrepreneurship. Most of these alumni have retired from their respective vo­cations, though their cherished core competences remain rele­vant to national growth and de­velopment.
