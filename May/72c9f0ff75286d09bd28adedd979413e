The United Kingdom has said that most Nigerian students and other nationalities will be banned from bringing fami­lies over to Britain in an im­migration crackdown being announced this week. According to The Sun UK, this comes as official figures out this Thursday are expected to show that net migration has rocketed to one million. It said a string of alarmed Tory MPs have broken cover to call for Rishi Sunak to get a grip on the rocketing numbers. Scrambling to get ahead of the bad news, ministers are expected to announce the immigration clampdown on Tuesday or Wednesday, The Sun UK said. The crackdown, it noted, will see all masters students and many other post grads banned from bringing family over. It said the ban will not ap­ply to PHD students, whose courses usually last between 3 and 5 years and are very highly skilled. Home Secretary Suella Braverman and her deputy Rob­ert Jenrick also wanted to lift the salary threshold, but were over­ruled after kick back from the Treasury, the report explained. Currently, foreign workers have to meet a £26,000 salary threshold to move to Britain, the report note, adding that but the Home Office wanted to raise this to £33,000 – which is the aver­age wage of a worker in Britain. POLL It said Rishi Sunak is ex­pected to come out fighting on immigration – pointing out they are figures he inherited as they date back to the year ending De­cember 2022 – two months after he became PM. There has been an explosion in the number of people com­ing to Britain piggybacking on their relative’s student visa. Students brought 135,788 family members to Britain last year – nine times more than in 2019, it noted. It said last year, 59,053 Nigeri­an students brought over 60,923 relatives. One Tory MP told The Sun on Sunday: “We have got to get a grip.”
