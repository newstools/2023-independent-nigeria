Manchester City have reportedly emerged as contenders to sign Aston Villa left-back Alex Moreno in the summer.Moreno has settled in quickly at Villa Park, replacing Lucas Digne in the starting XI under Unai Emery as Aston Villa have hit great form during 2023. With the future of Joao Cancelo still unclear after his loan move to Bayern Munich, Man City only have Sergio Gomez as a recognised left-back in their current squad. The Manchester Evening News claim that City boss Pep Guardiola is a big admirer of his Spanish compatriot and could make a move for Moreno when the transfer window opens at the end of the season. That would largely depend on the future of Cancelo, who is unlikely to remain in Bavaria, but may have no future at City. Chelsea are also said to be interested in Moreno, but with Ben Chilwell and Marc Cucurella in the ranks, that area of the pitch is already rather congested. Since joining Villa in January, Moreno has registered three assists and kept seven clean sheets as Emeryâ€™s side have surged up the Premier League table.
