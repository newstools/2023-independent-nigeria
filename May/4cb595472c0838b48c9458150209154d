Burnley gave manager Vincent Kompany a new five-year deal on Sunday as a reward for leading the club back to the Premier League in style. The former Manchester City defender won the Championship title with ease in his first season at Burnley after he replaced Sean Dyche and his success has attracted the interest of Premier League clubs Chelsea and Tottenham. But the 37-year-old Belgian has committed his future to the Clarets until 2028. Kompany said, “Burnley and Turf Moor felt right pretty much from the start — so it also feels right to sign for the next five years. “Together with the fans we have made Turf Moor a fortress again and continue to look forward to the future and the job of making Burnley better with every step.” Kompany replaced Dyche last summer after Burnley were relegated to the Championship. Chairman Alan Pace called Kompany an “extraordinary leader”, adding: “We are ecstatic Vincent has signed a new deal. “He is the perfect fit for how we all see Burnley Football Club moving forward.” POLL AFP
