The new Assistant Inspector General (AIG) of Police, Zone 5 Headquarters, Benin City, AIG Arungua Udo Nwauzei, has apologized to His Royal Majesty, Ewuare II, CFR, Oba of Benin over alleged misconduct by some Police personnel serving in the Zone. But the Police boss did not give details of his attribution. Speaking when he visited the Oba Palace in Benin City, he also solicited prayers from the Oba towards a better working relationship with the traditional institution in the Zone, comprising Bayelsa, Delta, and Edo States. Accompanied by senior Police officers in the Zone, AIG Nwauzei said, “Police are here for us to have a safe society and at the same time, to bring to your attention that we are still here as servants in this Kingdom; in any situation where we may err, we plead with you to speak to us as your own subjects, not throwing away the baby with the bathwater. “We also want to assure you that going forward, we are ready to deepen our relationship with you in service, especially, so that this era of your leadership will forever be remembered for being a peaceful one,” according to AIG Nwauzei. In his remarks, His Royal Majesty, Ewuare II, CFR, Oba of Benin, pledged the support of the traditional institution in the security of the lives and property of Nigerians. “We will try to ensure that the baby and bathwater are not thrown away. “We will do our best; God bless you. May your tenure be successful,” he said.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
