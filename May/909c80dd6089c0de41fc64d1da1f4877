Governor Udom Emmanuel has handed over the Dakka­da Skills Acquisition centre (DASAC) in Ikot Ada Idem, Ibiono Local Government to Akwa Ibom people as part of his parting gift. Commissioning the cen­tre on Wednesday, Emman­uel informed the people that the state government will be running the centre in collab­oration with the University of Lagos, which would be overseeing activities and op­erations of the centre. Emmanuel said the deci­sion to partner a university in the country instead of some institutions outside the coun­try was to ensure understand­ing of the state’s environment and socio-cultural structure. “I want to thank the Univer­sity of Lagos because when we approached them on this proj­ect for their collaboration and partnership, they did not turn us down. Meeting the Universi­ty of Lagos should assure you that this centre will be one of the best, a centre of excellence. “It is also a challenge for the University of Lagos because we had the opportunity of collaborating and partnering with other institutions out­side Nigeria. We have some in the Philippines, some from Pakistan, but I said no, east or west, that no other institution outside Nigeria would under­stand our environment, our socio-cultural structure to be able to manage in order to achieve our desired result,” he said. He Listed Faculties in The Centre to Include; Faculty of Agric- Business, Faculty of Steel and Building Technol­ogy, Faculty of Mechanical Fabrication and Automo­bile Engineering, Faculty of Power and Renewable En­ergy, Faculty of Hospitality and Lifestyle Management, Faculty of Information and Communication Technology, Faculty of Wood Technology, Faculty of General Studies and Skills Development, amongst others
