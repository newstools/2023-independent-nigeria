A Diaspora group under the aegis of Professionals for Good Governance and Social Justice (PGGSJ) has said that the declaration of Bola Tinubu of All Progressives Congress (APC) as President-elect, cannot stand in court, considering the number of irregularities characterized the February 25 2023 Presidential election. The group, in a statement by its Convener, Dr. Ben Chukwu, said that based on the independent investigation carried out by it on the outcome of February 25, Presidential election, it was observed that there were irregularities in the results released by Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), in Lagos, Rivers, Edo, Plateau, Borno, Kaduna, Ekiti and several other places in the country. The group claimed that from the investigation and analysis of presidential election results of Lagos state from IREV portal, Labour Party won APC with a total of 178,411 votes as against the figure declared by INEC where Labour Party won with 10,000 votes and it was important to note that this margin was after returning those obvious switched/altered votes to their rightful places, although most were not legible. The group added that the results equally showed that about 23% of them were blurred, mutilated, over-voted, absent and unaccounted for. “It is evident that APC being in control of Lagos cannot allow results they won to fall into the aforesaid categories. Hence, these are Labour Party results that have been doctored and bastardized by the APC and INEC under the supervision of security agents,” the group said. The group called on Nigerians, the security agencies and especially the Judiciary/ judges to save Nigeria from inevitable disintegration and crisis by jettisoning the corruptly announced result, upholding rule of law and restoring justice to the pained Nigerian masses.
