The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Dr Nasir Gwarzo, has commended the effort of technology firm, MTN Nigeria to help the returnees resettle in the country, as more evacuees return from the warring North African country Sudan. The telecommunications giant is offering N25,000 airtime and 1.5 GB data to 5000 returnees during this difficult time to provide relief and aid. The Minister, while speaking on Saturday at the Nnamdi Azikwe Stadium, mnoted that the actions of MTN Nigeria would “boost the morale of people who have gone through trauma,” adding that as they returned back home, “this kind of arrangement would make them feel loved, and cared for.” “I want to say we are proud of MTN” noted Dr Gwarzo. He also commenced the efforts of the MTN team on the ground at the airport handing out the dignity pack. “All of you are young men and women like the people coming back, so continue your good work. Nigeria is a place we must improve. “We see what can happen in a crisis, how a whole country can dismember in a short while. We should all pray that peace comes to Sudan and may war never come to Nigeria.”
