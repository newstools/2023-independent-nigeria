YENAGOA – Scores of aggrieved work­ers at Bayelsa State govern­ment-owned media outfits are protesting against the plan by the Ministry of In­formation, Orientation and Strategy to move into the Ernest Ikoli Media Com­plex in Yenagoa, the state capital. They contended that the edifice was built by Governor Douye Diri for the three state-owned media houses namely, the State Broadcasting Cor­poration, operators of Glory FM97.1 (popularly called Ra­dio Bayelsa); the State News­paper Corporation, publish­ers of New Waves; and the Niger Delta Television. They have warned that the situation could result in a face-off if the ministry insisted on pushing its plot through. The magnificent building was inaugurated by a former national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Iyorchia Ayu, on the invitation of Diri as a part of activities to celebrate the second anniversary of his administration in February 2022. The media complex with 430 offices, 107 restrooms, two restaurants and other facilities, is named after one of Nigeria’s foremost nation­alists and the first editor of the Daily Times newspaper, Ernest Ikoli, from Bayelsa. Some of the media out­fits’ workers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were afraid of victimisation, argued that the ministry was not sup­posed to be accommodated in the media complex going by the governor’s pronounce­ment. They said that staff mem­bers of the media houses were denied office space while several vacant office rooms had been ‘forcefully’ reserved for the workers of the ministry.
