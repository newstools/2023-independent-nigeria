LAGOS – Despite placing seventh and ninth positions in the female and male categories respective­ly in the recently held Africa Volleyball Club Championship in Tunisia, the Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo, has organised a heroic welcome for it’s repre­sentatives. The female Chief of Naval Staff, (CNS) Spikers produced the championship Most Valuable Player, (MVP). While the female team fin­ished seventh out of 40 teams, the male was ninth from 42 teams that participated in the continental championship. Represented by Real Admi­ral Sulaiman Garba, the Chief of Naval Staff said sports and sporting activities are the Nige­ria Navy’s priority, and aspires to take Volleyball (male and female) teams to top three positions in the continent. “We are going to the grass­roots to search for talents. We need the fresh blood to inject into the teams and to replace the ageing players. “The ageing players would not be laid off; instead, we are going to encourage them to do coaching courses so as to handle our teams. Currently, we have an FIVB Level 1 certified coach, and we still need more and would encourage our older players to go for such coaching programmes,” said Real Admiral Sulaiman Gar­ba.
