LAGOS – The case of Afrobeats musician, Seun Kuti, before a Chief Mag­istrates’ Court, sitting in Yaba Lagos on the alleged assault of a police officer was on Tuesday stalled due to absence of the pre­siding Magistrate. It was gathered that Chief Magistrate Adeola Olatubosun who had adjourned the hearing last week was absent because she was at a workshop. The singer has been in deten­tion since May 15, for allegedly assaulting a police officer on the Third Mainland bridge, prompt­ing the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, to order his arrest. The musician who turned himself in at the Police Com­mand, Ikeja, in the company of his lawyer and family representa­tive, and was later transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, where he has since been detained. Last Thursday, the Magis­trate ordered the police to dupli­cate and transfer the case file to the Office of the Directorate of Public Prosecutions at the Lagos State Ministry of Justice. She also granted a request by the Po­lice lead Counsel, Simon Lough (SAN), to detain the defendant for four more days to enable further investigations. According to the musi­cian’s counsel, Adeyinka Olu­mide-Fusika (SAN), the Advice of the DPP was not ready as the police investigation team was still holding on to the case file. He added that the release of Mr. Kuti on bail, as ordered by the Magistrate, is only waiting for administrative approval. That process has nothing to do with whether the court has a physical sitting. He expressed hope that he would be out on Tuesday on the bail granted him, having fulfilled the terms. Meanwhile, supporters of Kuti staged a rally outside the court pressing for his release.
