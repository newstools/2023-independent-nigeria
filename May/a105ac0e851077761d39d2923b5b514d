Kebbi state branch of the National Agency for food drugs administration and Control (NAFDAC) on Saturday held a one-day sensitisation workshop at the College of Nursing Sciences Birnin Kebbi. According to the state coordinator, Sulaiman Muyideen the programme is geared towards enlightening packaged water factory owners in Kebbi state on personal hygiene, the need for registration and to protect unsuspecting consumers from drinking harmful water assumed to be clean and well treated. He observed most owners of water factories have other businesses therefore not there to always monitor the water production in their factories even as most of their production managers are either not educated or lack scientific knowledge therefore not acquainted with procedures of packaged water production. The state chief added that the agency decided to bring them close to educate them as a regulatory body as in most of their operations they noticed issues of personal hygiene, improper water filtration due to weak filters and UV light which is critical to safe water production in any water factory. He said often times owners get admonished to change their water filters at regular intervals and to maintain a clean production by dressing well and keeping the area clean to avoid contact with harmful bacteria. Speaking further, Muyideen said that owners must ensure clean water sources because no amount of filtering will make the water safe for drinking if the source is bad â€œThose who refused to register or agree to change filters will pay administrative charges and as well risk temporary closure till they meet the requirements of the agency he said. POLL Over 1.5m was spent to organize the senstitasation workshop, therefore, the agency cannot afford to hold it at intervals but will remain annually he urged the participants to thoroughly read the hands out since they are straight and concise as well as beneficial to factories owners in the state.
