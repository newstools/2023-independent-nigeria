The Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) has called on President-elect, Bola Tinubu, his Vice, Kashim Shettima, and state governors to declare their assets before inauguration on May 29. The special assistant to CCB Chairman, Mustapha Musa, who disclosed this in a recent media interaction in Abuja stated that the asset declaration forms had been distributed to all incoming and re-elected public officials in the country. He said, “As an agency of government, we have already done our work according to the constitutional mandate; we have issued assets declaration forms to the newly elected and returning public officers. “But since asset declaration administration is a continuous process, we have started receiving some completed forms from some of them while some are yet to return theirs. “The constitution is clear on defaulters; hence they should declare before they are sworn in or they face the consequences.”
