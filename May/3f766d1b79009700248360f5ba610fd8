The All Progressives Congress Plateau State Chapter has condemned in very strong terms the dastardly and unprovoked attacks on the Kubwat and Fungzai communities of the Kombun District of Mangu Local Government Area, Plateau State. Spokesman of the Plateau chapter of APC Sylvanus Namang in a statement in Jos on Wednesday and made available to Daily Independent said reports from the local government area reveal that the perpetrators of these heinous acts left on their trail many lives lost with others maimed while houses and other unquantified property were senselessly destroyed. Namang lamented that this attack came in the wake of the farming season, where the peasants have just began planting their crops which they largely depend on for their subsistence, is as wicked as it is condemnable in all its ramifications. ‘” The displacement of the people who are running helter-skelter to safe havens in neighborhoods and the spiral effects of the attacks have created great anxiety and disquiet in the once peaceful local government area which has witnessed one surprise attacks too many in recent times.” According to Namang, “The APC in the state is greatly saddened by the unleashing of mayhem on unsuspecting people of the affected communities and hereby extends its heartfelt condolences and sympathy to the bereaved families, the Mishkaham Mwaghavul, Da John Putmang Hirse and Chairman of Mangu Local Government Area, Hon Minister Daniel Daput over this very painful development.” He added that the party also sympathises with other communities in the state particularly in Bokkos, Riyom and Barkin Ladi Local Government Areas which had witnessed a similar despicable loss of lives and property in the past few weeks or months.'” ‘” The party urges security agencies to go on the trail of the attackers and fish and deal decisively with them as they are certainly not spirits but identifiable human beings.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ According to him, APC calls for the mobilisation and reinforcement of more security forces to the local government area in order to nib this wicked act in the bud so that it does not spread to the neighbouring communities and other local government areas. POLL ‘” The APC calls on emergency aid and humanitarian agencies operating in the state to provide urgent and most needed relief to the victims of the attacks.” “‘ As a lasting solution, the APC calls for more vigilance and proactive measures as people who have lived together for centuries cannot be used by extraneous forces or covert agents of destruction to turn against each other at this period when goverment has put every mechanism in place to ensure peaceful co – existence of its citizens regardless of religion or ethnicity.”
