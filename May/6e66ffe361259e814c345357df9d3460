Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has mourned the death of the Olori Omo Oba of Ijebuland and founder of FCMB Group, Otunba Subomi Balogun. Balogun, a foremost banker, lawyer and entrepreneur, was reported to have died at the age of 89, in a London hospital after an illness. Mourning the passing of the business mogul and philanthropist, the governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, de­scribed the death of Balogun as a colossal loss, not only to Ogun State, but to Nigeria and the business world. He noted that the late Olori Omo Oba of Ijebuland was one of the foremost entrepreneurs who took banking to an envi­able level in the country. Abiodun added that apart from being a business magnate, Chief Subomi Balogun was a devoted Christian, a loving fa­ther and husband as well as a lover of Ijebuland. The governor said the con­tributions of the late banker to the socio-economic develop­ment of Ijebuland and Ogun State were humongous and beneficial to numerous people and entities. According to the statement, the vacuum created by the de­mise of Balogun will be diffi­cult to fill; pointing out that his love for humanity and dedica­tion to the service of God was worth emulation.
