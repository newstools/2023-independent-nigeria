Hon. Chidi Okonkwo, the proprietor of City FC Abuja, has explained how he has brought his experience to bear in the team that is currently campaigning in the Nigeria Nationwide League (NNL). While in a chat with select journalists on the sideline of an event in Lagos recently, Hon. Okonkwo said having successfully managed clubs in Ghana and Swaziland with successes recorded, it was not hard for him to manage City FC in Abuja, a team that is barely one year old. “Well, God has been great. I am a football businessman. What I am doing is what I did in Ghana for so many years for Berekum Chelsea as chairman for so many years; in Swaziland as chairman of Black Swallow for so many years with successes. So it’s not a new thing that I am doing in City FC of Abuja. “It is a gradual process; City FC is just a one year old club. I know by the next four, five years, the club will get to where I want it to be,” he said. On the challenges, he said: “It is just a club that started last season. The challenge is always there and the challenge is always funding but by God’s grace, we are pushing it and we will get there. “I have a dream that in the next five years, the club will be one of the best in Africa and we should be able to have our own stadium, play in the Champions League. It is a target and that is how I run clubs. In Ghana, Swaziland, I set a target. It is just to take it one after the other,” he said. On the comparison between Ghana and Nigerian league, he said Nigerian league is tougher while Ghana league is more organized. The experienced football administrator praised the Interim Management Committee of the Nigerian Premier Football League (NPFL) for its impact in the league this season, saying although tot is not yet uhuru, the league body had done well. POLL Hon. Okonkwo admitted that if the trend is sustained, it would be a matter of time before the NPFL would assume its rightful place in Africa.
