OWERRI  – With the countdown to the inauguration of the President-elect and the National Assembly, a polit­ical pressure group in the South East region report­edly pushing for greater national unity for the re­gion, the South East Youth for Democracy (SEYD), has warned that it would amount to a travesty of justice and for the region to be excluded from the leadership of the lawmak­ing body. The group, which is vexed over the perceived margin­alization and excursion of the region from the nation’s political leadership, argued that with a plethora of qual­ified sons and daughters in the House of Representatives, especially those in the ruling APC, it is only natural that one person be projected to oc­cupy the seat of the Deputy Speaker. Comrade Fabulous Wis­dom, the coordinator, in a statement made available to newsmen in Owerri, argued that the capacity of Benjamin Kalu for the exalted position shows in the number of bills that he either sponsored or co-sponsored and which is the highest in the entire South East with 43 to his name and three assented to by Mr. Pres­ident. He added noted that Kalu ranked the highest on mo­tions of national importance with 22 to his name. “On representation, Hon Kalu has attracted the com­paratively highest in percent­age of the value of infrastruc­ture attracted to Southeast which runs into billions of naira. On visibility as the im­age of the Igbo nation, he is the image maker of the House of Representatives for four years and has defended the House well and projected the image of the Igbo man better,” he stated.
