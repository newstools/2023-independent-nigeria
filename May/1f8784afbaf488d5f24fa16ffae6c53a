Nollywood actor, Yomi Fabiyi, through his human rights body, Break The Silence Foundation, has filed a petition calling for the arrest and prosecution of actress and comedian, Damilola Adekoya, popularly known as Princess along with her “cohorts”. In an open letter to the newly re-elected governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Fabiyi noted that a few days after his colleague, Baba Ijesha, who is serving jail time for the rape of a minor, was set up and arrested, a test was conducted on the girl (victim) and the semen found in her private was definitely not for Baba Ijesha. Fabiyi, who said that previous correspondence with the governor were not replied noted that Princess, the victim’s foster mother is accessory after the fact as she also has many cases to answer in this matter if the honest justice and procedure are allowed. “The other suspect, the security in the house with the alias ‘Okele’ escaped arrest. They have not been tried for almost two years now. I thought he will be presented for trial during Baba Ijesha’s case but the prosecution gave excuses on why he was not on trial, meaning a potential pedophile is allowed walking free, and Baba Ijesha who was lured to sentence. “The sad news is that he may have continued sexually exploiting the victim and unsuspecting victims who may be secretly licking their wounds. I say this because Princess Comedian confirmed in court she was aware a year before Baba Ijesha’s trap that the duo of Damola and her house security guard Okele have been sexually abusing the same bait girl, which she sought spiritual help only for,” he wrote. He further appealed that the governor swings to action to kindly save the girl and save human rights.
