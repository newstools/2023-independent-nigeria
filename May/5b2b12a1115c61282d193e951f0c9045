Asaba, the Delta state capital last weekend hosted a one day Hepatitis awareness campaign programme, organised by “The Clem Agba Foundation (TCAF)” during which free screening and vaccination were administered on residents. The event held at the St Patrick’s Catholic Church, Asaba where many residents took the opportunity to know their Hepatitis status and availed themselves of the free screening and vaccination rendered by the Foundation. Speaking to journalists in Benin City, leader of the volunteer team made up of doctors, laboratory scientists, nurses and others , Dr Philip Ugbodaga said “The foundation was established in 2014 to create awareness about hepatitis that has a Hepatitis B prevalence rate of 8.1% and 1% for Hepatitis C with most people infected unaware of their status leading to underreporting, under-diagnosis and under-treatment.” According to him, “Most patients present to the hospital at advanced stages of liver cancer with or without liver cirrhosis which are preventable if detected early. “We advocate for more enlightenment campaigns and screening if we are to meet the 2030 target of eliminating the disease. “We commend the ministry of health for developing the National Strategic Framework for Viral Hepatitis.” he said. A beneficiary of the exercise and a member of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) serving in Asaba, Ogbu Chinaza who said she had been seeking for an opportunity to get vaccinated however commended the Honourable Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba and his wife for the initiative.
