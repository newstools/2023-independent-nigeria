Lionel Messi will leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season, according to reports.The 35-year-old Argentina international has a contract that runs until the summer and he is now expected to leave the French capital as a free agent, according to the BBC and others.Messi had reportedly previously agreed a single-year extension to his deal at PSG, but neither the player nor club wishes to proceed with the arrangement. Messi’s father, Jorge, reportedly told the club of his decision several weeks ago, and the news comes after the club suspended the player for two weeks for travelling to Saudi Arabia without permission.Messi has been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia, where Cristiano Ronaldo plays for Al-Nassr, and a potential return to Barcelona, though they also have financial concerns that might not be overcome.Those concerns are not shared by Inter Miami, the MLS side co-owned by David Beckham, who visited PSG’s training ground and met Messi, amongst others, last month.PSG are said to want to bring in younger players as part of an overhaul to their big-spending transfer strategy, and that could include selling Neymar, who is out injured after another disappointing campaign. With UEFA’s financial fair play regulations in force, letting Messi go would allow sporting director Luis Campos to bring in new players as part of a squad refresh.Messsi had joined PSG in 2021 with two years agreed, and an option to extend, which will now not be taken up. While PSG look set to tie up the Ligue 1 trophy yet again, they have failed in their quest to lift the Champions League trophy, something they thought Messi’s arrival may help them achieve.Messi has so far played 71 games for PSG, scoring 31 goals, and with this news and his current suspension, he may have played his final game for the club already with weeks of the season remaining.PSG fans gathered in Paris on Wednesday to protest against Messi’s future at the club.Messi is set to miss the next two PSG games, at Troyes this Sunday, and against Ajaccio on May 13. He could return against Auxerre on May 21.PSG are currently five points clear of second-placed Marseille in Ligue 1.
