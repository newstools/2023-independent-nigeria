Barcelona’s pursuit of Vitor Roque looks more complicated than it did a few months ago. With more and more clubs aware of the youngster’s development at Athetico Paranaense, the Catalans are facing immense competition in the race to sign the forward. According to Mundo Deportivo, Newcastle United have recently made a move to sign Vitor Roque by submitting a lucrative proposal. With the backing of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, the Magpies have proposed a deal that is far more attractive than their Premier League rivals Chelsea and Arsenal – two other English outfits involved in the chase. With Premier League clubs being able to offer significantly higher sum, Barça are facing a precarious situation. Due to the FFP regulations, the club are not being able to offer a fortune, and are thus reliant on their sporting project. Newcastle United may have offered a lucrative deal, but they are yet to offer an attractive sporting project, which could be critical in the bid to sign the Brazilian forward. Although Athletico PR are holding out for the highest bidders, the final decision will likely be made by the player, who has openly admitted his desire to join Barcelona. The player’s agent had even visited the Camp Nou facilities earlier in the year. Not being able to compete with Premier League clubs, Barcelona’s only hope is to lure Vitor Roque through their sporting project under Xavi Hernandez, which has produced a series of young talents in recent years. With Robert Lewandowski also in the final phase of his career, there is an excellent opportunity to pitch Vitor Roque as the leader of the club’s attacking unit in the years to come.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ But whether or not that strategy becomes fruitful remains to be seen.
