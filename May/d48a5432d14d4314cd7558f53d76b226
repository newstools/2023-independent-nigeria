The Governor-elect of Cross River State, Senator Bassey Otu, has congratulated the entire workforce in the state on the occasion of the 2023 International Labour Day celebration. Labour Day otherwise known as Workers’ Day or May Day is a day (May 1) set aside to celebrate workers across the globe for the important role they play in society and to raise awareness of their rights and protection from exploitation. In a message of solidarity, Otu described Cross River workers as hardworking, while applauding them for their sacrifices, productivity, commitment and contributions to the growth and development of the state and the nation at large. The ex-parliamentarian who will be taking over the mantle of leadership in the state from the outgoing Governor Ben Ayade on May 29, reiterated his vow to ensure that the interests and concerns of workers are appropriately addressed in his administration. Otu’s message reads: “Dear Comrades, Today, I stand in solidarity with all hardworking workers in Cross River State as you mark the 2023 Workers’ Day celebration. “May 1st of every year avails us the opportunity to celebrate all of you who labour hard to keep our state working. “As the most important factor of production and engine room of all governments, we will ensure that all genuine interests of our workers are properly addressed, as captured in our People’s First Manifesto. “I understand your struggles and concerns, let me reassure you that my administration will work with the leadership of the NLC (Nigeria Labour Congress), TUC (Trade Union Congress) and all labour leaders and organizations to provide a comfortable, well-trained 21st-century workforce.
