Nottingham Forest beat Arsenal at the City Ground to secure their Premier League survival and crown Manchester City as champions. According to BBC, Taiwo Awoniyi’s 19th-minute goal was enough to seal victory and spark jubilant scenes from the home supporters at the final whistle. Arsenal dominated possession but Mikel Arteta’s men could not find a way through Forest’s spirited defence in order to force City to win a fifth title in six years themselves. Not that Forest and their noisy supporters were bothered about Pep Guardiola and his team. After what must have seemed like an age as he paced up and down his technical area, waiting for seven minutes of injury time to pass and the loss of goalkeeper Keylor Navas in the very last seconds, Forest boss Steve Cooper was able to celebrate survival. In the stand above, owner Evangelos Marinakis was also hugged by those around him, having been rewarded for keeping faith with Cooper during a tumultuous campaign.
