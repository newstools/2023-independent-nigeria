Felix Aondona Imem, author of the book, ‘The Man Called Tony Elumelu’ said the life story of Elumelu, the business icon may not be complete without the book. While he explained that the book was meant to immortalize Elumelu, Imem stated that he wrote the dynamic biography book to honor Elumelu whom he admired from afar. Speaking with newsmen in Makurdi on Tuesday, Imem who said he thought that the businessman would use the occasion of his 60th birthday to commemorate the book, also wondered why Elumelu didn’t. The author who is an indigene of Benue State pointed out that “As observed by late Myles Munroes, ‘everything here on earth is programmed to change except truth and principle.’ “As I have chosen to walk in truth, I see it wise and the right thing to do is immortalizing Tony Elumelu in a book as a ‘reference and standard’, and propagate his enduring legacy, forever increasing impact and inspiration for the present and forthcoming generations.” Imem who was probably dismayed that Elumelu didn’t commemorate the book wondered if the book, “The Man Called Tony Elumelu” was actually delivered to the business magnate. He said, “However, before Tony Elumelu turned 60 years, I sent the book I authored in his name and honor through ‘DHL’, and it was delivered and received in his Heirs Holdings Plc, the headquarters, Heirs place, 1 Macgregor Road Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria. On the 20th of February 2023.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “I hoped and expected that he should have launched or commemorated his 60th birthday with the said book: The Man Called Tony Elumelu. POLL “Unfortunately, it wasn’t so. And that has kept me puzzled. “As a roundup remark, Tony’s life, story, and legacy will never be complete without the said dynamics biography book authored in his name and honor”, Imem declared.
