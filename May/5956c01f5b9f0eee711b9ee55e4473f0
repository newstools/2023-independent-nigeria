The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo state has expressed optimism about all citizens and residents of Nigeria (including workers) getting a better deal of life abundance, prosperity and brighter prospect in the renewed hope mantra of the incoming administration of the President-elect, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu. This was contained in a statement issued by the party on Monday in Ibadan commemoration of this year’s Workers’ Day celebration. In the statement which was signed by the Publicity Secretary of Oyo APC, Olawale Sadare, the party congratulated all strata of workers in the state while it urged them to keep the hope of better living and realization of dreams alive. “Workers in both formal and informal sectors of the Nigerian economy are among the most resilient, productive and dynamic in the whole world and they deserve to be celebrated everyday because of what they contribute to our national life. Even as May 1 remains an international day of celebrating workers, we at the APC attach so much importance to encouraging and motivating those who work for life to be worth living for all and sundry. “It is on this note that we once again appreciate all public servants, professionals, artisans, transporters, businessmen/women, pensioners among others from across the 33 Local Government Areas in the state who voted the candidates of our great Party in the last general election. We assure you all that the incoming Tinubu administration, slated for inauguration later this month, will not only improve on the gains of the last eight years but also guarantee all round welfarism to the Nigerian workers as well as all citizens and residents of the country.” Oyo APC stated.
