On this week’s Glo-sponsored CNN African Voices Changemakers, Nigerian singing sensation, P-Square, will be featured as special guests. The identical twin brothers opened their home studio doors to CNN’s Larry Madowo in Lagos, where they are working on their first studio album in more than 9 years. As a pair, Peter Okoye, well known as Mr. P and Paul Okoye known to his fans as Rudeboy, have been an entertainment sensation not only to fans in Nigeria but also globally. Their hit songs, including Chop My Money, Bring It On, Beautiful Onyinye, E No Easy, Danger, Bizzy Body and several others have won several awards, including BET, KORA, MOBO, MTV Europe, and Channel O music awards.
