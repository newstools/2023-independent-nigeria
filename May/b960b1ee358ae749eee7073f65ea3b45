A Catholic priest Rev Fr Mathias Opara who was kidnapped in Imo has regained freedom. It was gathered that the priest was released unhurt on Sunday night. Recall that after attending the burial rituals for the father of one of his colleagues at Izombe Community in the Oguta LGA, the priest identified as Owu Ujo, was abducted along Ejemekwuru-Ogbaku Road in Oguta and Mbaitoli Local Government Areas of Imo State. A source close to the Archbishop of the archdiocese told our correspondent on Sunday that the priest was released on Sunday night. He said that the Archbishop personally confirmed it to him that the priest was released by his abductors on Sunday night.
