For MAN, it is critically important that the challenges identified by manufacturers in the course of the survey it carried out are adequately addressed as follows: (1) Improving Forex availability • Prioritize forex intervention through the official market, particularly to support the raw materials and machine needs of the industries; • improve forex allocation to industrial sector and enhance the capacity of designated banks to efficiently process application of forex by manufacturers; • grant concessional forex allocation at the official forex market to industries for importation of productive inputs that are not locally available; • unify the various forex windows in the country; (2) Energy/Power Supply ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ • Develop and implement a roadmap for improved power supply focusing on off-grid solutions and independent power projects by the private sector to ensure adequate supply of energy for production and also attract and expand investment POLL • Carry out further investment in the electricity value chain and commit to adding 10000MW to the current electricity distributed in the country. • Embrace and support significant development of energy mix and renewable: the country has huge potentials for Solar and Wind • Commission the resuscitation of the existing national refineries to produce fuels locally; • Review the gas price for domestic consumption to be in tandem with the export price which is about $3.25 per cubic meter • Promote energy efficiency and renewable energy deployment in industries and homes; • Quickly incentivize more investment in gas aggregation to end gas flaring; • Optimize crude oil production based on OPEC quota and gas production to ramp up revenue now that hydrocarbon is still saleable; (3) Resuscitation of Domestic Refining • Review the current status of the four national refineries to determine their current state; • Commission the CHIYODA Group, the Japanese company that built the national refineries to rehabilitate them to resume domestic refining; • Review the Nigerian energy policy and ensure that available energy sources, particularly natural gas is optimally explored and exploited. • Create functional incentive to attract private sector investment in gas aggregation to end the current gas flaring; • Create incentive to resuscitate private sector investment in the petrochemical industry; • Improve the capital expenditure on the energy sector for greater public investment in energy development • Carry out and utilize the outcome, the Egypt’s energy development strategy (4) Raw Materials Production, Supply and Utilization • Incentivize investment in local development of raw materials; Give attention to domestic production of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) and Basic chemicals • Refocus on Backward Integration and Resource-Based Industrialization; • Reverse the duty for Annealed Coldroll back to 45 percent from the new 5 percent. • Re-invigorate the backward integration policy through the use of local resources to provide raw materials to the industries; (5) Taxes and Government Regulation • Publish the list of approved harmonized taxes and levies for the manufacturing sector by the Joint Tax Board (JTB) to address the issues of multiples taxes and levies; • Commence implementation of the harmonized taxes and levies project which should be monitored and enforced strictly by the Joint Tax Board (JTB); • Jettison the proposed increase in Excise Duties. • Develop a comprehensive and integrated framework that will facilitate the intentional movement of operators in the informal sector to the formal sector. • Widen the tax net rather than increasing the tax base or the tax burden of existing tax payers. • Ffully implement the Steve Oronsanye Report on the reduction and re-alignment of Government Agencies and Parastatals in order to streamline the number of taxes, levies, fees and administrative charges; (6) Infrastructure • Investment in transportation sector (road, rail, waterways etc.) to mitigate the high cost of transportation logistics in the country; • Invest significantly in ports infrastructure including scanners, etc.; • Resuscitate the moribund rail tracks leading from the ports to industrials areas; • Government Agencies operating at the ports should work harmoniously, particularly in the implementation of the recent migration of National list to ECOWAS CET Chapter 99; • Implement the single window platform to eliminate significant human inference in the ports clearing system; • Improve the time taken to clear machines and raw-materials at the national ports while making the link road accessible. (7) Funding • Set up a monitoring and evaluation platform with private sector representatives to oversee the disbursement of the various development funds meant for the industries; • Provide Credit guarantee for industrial loans from commercial banks; • Create development funding windows for SMEs with liberal conditionality • Strengthen the Bank of Industry (BOI) and Bank of Agriculture (BOA) to adequately provide liberal finance for the manufacturing sector; Avail to the productive sector the CBN non-oil export stimulation facility with liberal term and condition (8) Economic/Industrial Policies • Allow industrial policies in the country to gestate with proper monitoring and evaluation rather than jettisoning or altering them unduly frequently. • Strengthen the implementation of the Executive Order 003 and 005; • Monitor the implementation of Executive Order 003 and 005 to ensure compliance by MDAs so as to boost activities in the manufacturing sector. • Through fiscal and monetary policy authorities’ joint effort, formulate and implement a national policy that would address the current high inflation in the country
