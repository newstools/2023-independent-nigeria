ABUJA – Mr Tein Jack-Rich, a frontline presidential aspirant under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has allayed fears about the capacity of the President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to deliver on his mandate. He, therefore, urged all Nigerians to come out en mass to Support the President-elect who is to be sworn in today in Abuja. Jack-Rich made the call as part of his goodwill message to Nigerians. He said: “All Nigerians need to come out en mass to support our incoming President because we have succeeded in going through tremendous and consistent transition of the 4th Republic. “I know you may not be happy, I know some hearts may be broken, but it is for the good of our republic, so we do not need to hate, all we need to do is love right now.’’ According to the philanthropist and oil mogul, Tinubu does not belong to the APC, he is the President of Nigeria, and so all political parties should come together to support the president-elect. “All Nigerians should come together to support this great president with phenomenal IQ and ingenious ideas because he is going to put together great minds that will change the narrative and then present a country among comity of nations, Jack-Rich also expressed a firm belief in Nigerians’ resolve to ensure a better country. POLL “Yes, I know that you can do it. Do not hate me for what I said, it is for the good of all, because I know when the president-elect is sworn in, he is going to be for all irrespective of political, religious or ethnic affiliations. He therefore, urged all, including those who feared they would be isolated, to join hands in ensuring a smooth and peaceful inauguration on Monday, because they had nothing to fear with Tinubu at the helm of Nigeria’s affairs.
