Under Camillus Ukah’s four years of ANA presidency, the association has successfully organised the annual event known as Authors’ Groove, held during the Nigeria International Book Fair. This event serves as a platform for discussing the latest trends in Nigerian literature and attracts both authors and book enthusiasts. This was stated in a statement signed by Wole Adedoyin, ANA PRO, stressing that Authors’ Groove has become a significant highlight of the Nigeria International Book Fair, attracting both established and emerging authors, scholars, and literature enthusiasts. “Through the thought-provoking themes and engaging panel discussions, these events have contributed to the growth and recognition of Nigerian literature on both national and international platforms. Under Camillus Ukah’s ANA presidency, Authors’ Groove has solidified its position as an essential event for literary discourse in Nigeria, further enriching the vibrant literary landscape of the country. “In 2020, amidst the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the theme of Authors’ Groove was ‘Creative and Other Writings During the COVID-19 Pandemic & Afterwards,” it partly read. The panel discussion, moderated by Olatunbosun Taofeek, featured esteemed panelists like Henry Akubuiro, Anote Ajeluoruo, Ekaete George, Sola Alamutu, and Onyekachi Onuoha. Despite the pandemic, the event successfully took place on September 4, 2020, utilizing the Zoom platform.

Dr. Charles Akwen from Mountain Top University and Dr. Promise Adelie from the University of Lagos delivered insightful speeches on the theme, with Olatunbosun Taofeek moderating the event. POLL Adedoyin observed that throughout these four years, Camillus Ukah’s ANA presidency has played a vital role in organising and ensuring the success of the Authors’ Groove events. Taofeek Olatunbosun, the former National PRO of ANA, has been instrumental in supporting these endeavors, serving as the anchor and moderator for each event. Together, they have fostered a platform for Nigerian authors to showcase their works, exchange ideas, and contribute to the development of literature in Nigeria.
