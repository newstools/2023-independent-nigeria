Mrs Hafsat Yerima, the Yobe State NYSC Coordinator, has advised Corps Members deployed to Yobe State to be good ambassadors of the Scheme and respect the culture, customs and traditions of their host communities. The Coordinator gave the advice during the debriefing of the 2023 Batch ‘A’ Stream II Corps Members held at the NYSC Orientation Camp Dazigau Yobe State. Mrs Yerima also enjoined them to sustain the tempo of discipline they exhibited here on camp at their Places of Primary Assignment and in all their dealings. She equally, warned them against being partisan and indulging in anti-social activities that will dent their image and that of the Scheme. The NYSC boss, encouraged them to continue with the post-camp SAED training as a way of enhancing their economic viability. She equally, appreciated them for their active participation in all programmes and activities which resulted in the overall success of the orientation course.
