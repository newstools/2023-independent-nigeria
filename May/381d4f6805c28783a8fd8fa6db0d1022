Media Rights Agenda (MRA) on Wednesday called on the Federal Gov­ernment to ensure ade­quate protection for media freedom in law and in prac­tice, saying the relentless attacks on the media over the years had also under­mined the general human rights protection for all Nigerians, democracy and sustainable development in the country. In a statement to com­memorate this year’s World Press Freedom Day and the 30th anniversary of proc­lamation of the Day by the United Nations General As­sembly in 1993, MRA said by strengthening the right to freedom of expression, which is a critical human right that serves as a driver for all other human rights, the government could en­sure a future where all other human rights are adequately protected and respected in Nigeria. MRA’s Programme Di­rector, Ayode Longe, not­ed in the statement that given enormous duty im­posed on the media by the Constitution, particularly Section 22, which requires the media sector to ensure that the government lives up to its responsibilities to the people and to hold the government accountable, the failure to provide ade­quate protection for the me­dia was impeding its ability to perform these functions upon which good gover­nance, democracy and sus­tainable development in Nigeria depend. He said: “The clear evi­dence before us is that no other sector of the Nigerian society has faced such re­lentless attacks for decades as the media sector has had to endure. By placing the responsibility of polic­ing a powerful institution like the government on the media without adequate or commensurate protec­tions, the media has been made a target for attacks by all corrupt or incompetent government officials seek­ing to hide their misdeeds or mistakes.” Observing that this year’s World Press Free­dom Day is being com­memorated with the theme “Shaping a future of rights: Freedom of Ex­pression as a driver for all other human rights”, Longe said: “It is only in an environment where freedom of expression is adequately protected and respected that citizens can have the confidence to en­gage in public discourse; criticize government’s policies and officials; make meaningful contributions to policies; advocate for their own rights, as well as the rights of others.”
