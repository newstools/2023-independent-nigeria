including Ebuka Obi-Ochendu, Rick Hassani and a couple of others, recently turned up to support hyper-realistic artist, Saga, as he holds his debut art exhibition, ‘A Subtle Reflection’ at Omenka Gallery, Victoria Island Lagos. The star-studded event, with celebrities from the film and music industry in attendance, showcased Saga’s works, with featured pieces from collaborating artists Raji Bamidele and Ken Nwadiogbu. The artworks were all centered around the theme of self-reflection and introspection. Other notable attendees were Afrobeats Artist Iyanya, video director TG Omori, as well as several Big Brother Naija Reality Show ex-housemates, who came to support and appreciate the thought-provoking pieces on display — a diverse range of artworks, from paintings, to charcoal drawings, hyper realistic pencil sketches and mixed media pieces. From exploring a variety of themes including personal identity and mental health to social issues and cultural heritage, each piece offers a unique and subtle reflection on the artist’s perspective, making A Subtle Reflection a true celebration of the power of Art to provoke thought, inspire emotion, and promote self-reflection — the mirror for viewers to look inward and reflect on their own experiences.
