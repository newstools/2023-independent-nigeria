Asaba, the Delta State capital, last weekend hosted a one day Hepatitis awareness campaign programme, organised by “The ClemAgbaFoundation(TCAF)” during which free screening and vaccination were adminis­tered on residents. The event was held at the St Patrick’s Catholic Church, Asaba, where many residents took the opportunity to know their Hepatitis status and availed themselves of the free screening and vaccination rendered by the Foundation. Speaking to journalists in Benin City, leader of the volunteer team, made up of doctors, laboratory scientists, nurses, among others, Dr. Phil­ip Ugbodaga, said: “The Foun­dation was established in 2014 to create awareness about hepatitis that has a Hepatitis B prevalence rate of 8.1% and 1% for Hepatitis C with most people infected, unaware of their status leading to under­reporting, under-diagnosis and under-treatment.” According to him, “Most patients present to the hospi­tal at advanced stages of liver cancer with or without liver cirrhosis, which are prevent­able if detected early. “We advocate for more en­lightenment campaigns and screening if we are to meet the 2030 target of eliminating the disease. “We commend the ministry of health for developing the National Strategic Framework for Viral Hepatitis,” he said. A beneficiary of the exer­cise and a member of the Na­tional Youth Service Corps (NYSC) serving in Asaba, Ogbu Chinaza, who said she had been seeking for an oppor­tunity to get vaccinated, how­ever, commended the Minis­ter of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba and his wife for the initiative.
