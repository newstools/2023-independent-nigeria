LAGOS – With less than one week to the inauguration of a new government on May 29, Kehinde Oshliaja Foundation on Monday urged the President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the in-coming governors, and members of the 10th National Assembly, to seek ways of re-uniting the different ethnic groups in the country and prioritize the welfare of all People Living With Disabilities (PLWDs) in the country. The Foundation congratulated the entire Nigerian citizens for their resilience and patriotism, especially PLWDs, for their perseverance, ruggedness, especially towards the end of the Muhammadu Buhari administration. Convener of the Foundation, Kehinde Oshilaja, while delivering the foundation’s monthly interactive session with journalists at its headquarters in Ebute-Metta, Lagos, on Monday, said: “While we await and watch keenly the development of the tribunal on various election petitions, we, members of the PLWDs would not fold our hands but voice out our experience on the affairs of this country, especially under the outgoing administration, which bothers insecurity, poverty and hunger, health, and education deficiency. “The foundation condemned the act in its entirety.” According to him, “After unity and re-unity of the entire country, the President-elect and the entire governors should employ due diligence to the security of lives and property, poverty and hunger, health and proffer lasting legacy in the education sector of the entire country. “Let the new administration by all standards enable the citizenry to have a relief and forget what the country witnessed and is still witnessing in the form of insecurity, kidnapping here and there, fear of attacks even during daylights, including stigmatization of PLWDs, among others.” He called on the incoming administration to ensure that the education of Nigerian children at all levels is given a top priority, as this is the best legacy the country can bequeath to its youth. The government should improve the healthcare delivery system so that the current medical tourism among top government functionaries and privileged few can be completely reduced or eradicated.
