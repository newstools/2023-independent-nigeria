The Ogun state government has given eateries and food outlets in the Oke-Ilewo axis of Abeokuta a seven-day ultimatum to improve on their hygiene or face total closure and possible prosecution. Ola Oresanya, Commissioner for Environment in the state gave the warning after an inspection visit to the affected eateries and food outlets. He said they must immediately improve on their operational hygiene so as to safeguard their customers and residents of the state from the risk of food poisoning resulting from their present condition. According to Oresanya, it was discovered that accumulated fats, oils and grease and other food materials in confined chambers were not scooped daily thus allowing their breakdown by microbes which releases toxic waste. “Aside from this, it was discovered that they were discharging their untreated wastewater directly into the public drain, open holes were also seen within their septic tanks holding fecal matters, general poor housekeeping as well as evidence of rat infestation within their stores areas.” Oresanya added that already the state government has taken pieces of evidence against the concerned eateries and food outlets in case they need to be prosecuted for food poisoning and a possible escalation to other federal agencies if they fail to correct and improve on all anomalies, pointed out to them within the stipulated days. He assured that the state government monitoring team will continue to enforce the state sanitation laws urging all eateries and food outlets to be on the right side of the law as the government will always protect the interest of its residents when it comes to public hygiene and safety.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
