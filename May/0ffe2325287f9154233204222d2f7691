Burkina Faso have ended the continuance of Nigeria’s Golden Eaglets in the U-17 2023 African Cup of Nations after a nail-biting 2-1 victory at the quarter-final knockout stage in Algeria. Two goals by Burkina Faso’s player Aboubacar Camara in either half secured a spot for them in the FIFA World Cup billed to hold in November. A consolation goal by Nigeria’s Abubakar Abdullahi in the 67 minutes was not enough to salvage a victory for the Nduka Ugbade boys. The loss means that Nigeria will not participate in the U-17 World Cup.
