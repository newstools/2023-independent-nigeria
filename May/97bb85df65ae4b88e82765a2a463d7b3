Chief Audu Ogbeh, a former Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, has de­cried the high cost of food items in Nigeria. Ogbeh, who stated this in Abuja at the National Farm­ers’ Day Campaign Launch, organised by Alliance for Sci­ence and 1 Hectare 1 Family, said Nigeria is in a food crisis. With the burgeoning pop­ulation of Nigeria, he called for concerted efforts to scale up food productivity to re­duce poverty and crime in the country. The former minister of ag­riculture, identified lack of ac­cess to credit by farmers, lack of value addition to agricultur­al produce, among others, as part of challenges confronting the agricultural sector. According to him, “Hunger is in Nigeria. We have a food crisis. “Our farmers can’t access credit. When I was a minister of agriculture for one tenure, we wanted to copy China on agriculture financing, where farmers are encouraged to own shares in the Bank of Agriculture. “In this arrangement, ev­ery farmer is a shareholder. Taking a loan in the bank to finance agriculture today is a herculean task,” he said. He added that due to the high interest rate, many farm­ers who obtained loans from banks, have great difficulty in repayment. POLL In her remarks, Dr. Sheila Ochugboju, Executive Direc­tor of Alliance for Science, called for the application of agricultural innovations, es­pecially biotechnology to pro­duce resilient crops, increase productivity and enhance livelihoods.
