The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),is set to hold an enlightenment programme for staff of the Federal Road Safety Corps as part of efforts to ensure the continued enlightenment of investors to enable them take more informed decisions. The Enlightenment programme with the theme “Investor Safety” is to be held across 12 Zonal Commands in the country. The campaign is expected to hold in Kaduna, Sokoto, Adamawa, Kwara, Bauchi and Plateau states. The enlightenment campaign to the FRSC zones is in continuation of collaboration between the Commission and the Corps to ensure that staff members are knowledgeable about the opportunities available in the capital market. Director Market Development of the SEC, Mr. Nestor Ikeagu, had recently stated that such enlightenments are part of the Commission’s determination to ensure that every facet of the Nigerian society has a grasp of the workings of the capital market and its benefits. According to the SEC Director, the outreach program will be held at the six locations simultaneously on Tuesday May 9, 2023 with an expected participation of a large number of officers and it is hoped that these programs will become a continuous feature in the Corps training programme. The Commission reiterated its commitment to educate all stakeholders in order to encourage participation by local investors in the local capital market, which is currently dominated by foreign investors. “We will enlighten them on other more profitable investment options available in the capital market so that they can plan as well as educate them on how to avoid illegal fund managers” he said. POLL Ikeagu said some initiatives introduced by the Commission were to ensure an investor-friendly and attractive system such as e-DMMS, regularisation of multiple accounts, Direct cash settlement, transmission of shares, among others.
