With the full circle of national and sub­national general elections completed between February 25 and March 18, and the political battle shifting to the elections tribunals, it is time to take stock of the tumultuous eight (8) years of the outgoing regime of President Muhammadu Buhari that has seen Nigerian ship of state sink very deep into the abyss of poverty and sea of anarchy. By so doing, we would be setting the agenda for President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who is poised to take over the reins of governance on May 29 which is barely a month away, all things being equal. Suddenly, but pleasantly, the tension which had been very palpable in the polity as a negative fallout of the end of 2023 general elections, seems to be abating. And it is being attributed to the convergence of both Easter, which is a Christian rite of fasting in commemoration of the death and celebration of rise from the grave of our Lord Jesus Christ, the son of God in Christendom and the Ramadan, which is a Muslim period of fasting for about a month as a way of seeking reconnection to Allah and showing of love to one another, particularly the wealthy to the poor amongst Islamic faithful. At the risk of being tagged a religionist, since I am sounding like one, I am of the conviction that it is not by mere happenstance that the two critical events that promote tolerance, forgive­ness and peace in the calendar of Christians and Muslims would hold simultaneously or back-to-back in the month of April. Again, while Easter is an opportunity for Christians to humble themselves in grief by fast­ing in remembrance of the death of Jesus Christ before celebrating his subsequent rise from the grave, Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam during which Muslim faithful engage in the sac­rifice of also fasting to purify the soul, empathize with the less fortunate in society and strengthen family and community ties. Ultimately, a combination of both religious ceremonies that are geared towards religious re­birth or reconnection by faith adherents is a phe­nomenon that is desperately needed in Nigeria at this critical point in time that the outcome of the general elections was at a point threatening to cause a sort of chasm in the polity.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Hence, it is believed that it is the hand of God at work in Nigeria that helped pacify the aggrieved Nigerians that were nursing or tend­ing towards seeking redress outside the ambits of the law which is tantamount to promoting a breakdown of law and order. POLL The justification for the assertion above is that a co-occurrence of both religious events which are under guarded by sobriety which presuppos­es calmness of spirit and personal self-control immediately after the very contentious 2023 elec­tions may be God’s way of fulfilling His intention to reset Nigeria for good. As we all are well aware, the religious rites and ceremonies associated with the Christian and Muslim events actually compelled people of both faiths who constitute the largest population of Nigeria to observe penance via the sacrifice of fasting which is the underpinning message and purpose of the rituals for Christians and Muslims and why most Nigerians remained disciplined, sober and peaceful. It is safe to conclude that had majority of folks not been observing the religious rituals of fasting, most aggrieved politicians and their thugs could have become unruly and disruptive as the aftermath of the controversial elections 2023 result. And the harmony of purpose intrinsic in both the Christian and Muslim ceremonies being held soon after the general elections organized between the months of February and March and April is not surprising. That is because Christianity and Islam are part of the three (3) Abrahamic religions birthed by the father of creation or first prophet of God— Abraham as chronicled in the holy Bible and the holy Quran. The third in the Abrahamic religion’s trium­virate is Judaism. Unsurprisingly, both Christian and Muslim leaders have been united in enjoining our politi­cal leaders and admonishing their followers to toe the path of forgiveness so that political stability would be restored and sustained to enable peace reign so that progress and development can take hold in our country. Without detracting from the assiduous and commendable efforts of the Directorate of State Services, DSS, that has been working round the clock to ensure that potential crisis were nipped in the bud, it cannot be denied that it is as a result of the efforts of Christian clergies and Islamic clerics, who are preaching peace and harmony in our country at the same time that has made it possible for frayed nerves to be calmed down and why our country seems to be on track to witness a peaceful transition of political power on May 29 from President Muhammadu Buhari (2015-2023) to President-elect Bola Tinubu (2023….). To encourage the incoming administration and also remind it not to be carried away by the euphoria of power of which it is on the cusp of receiving, it is apropos that it is guided via a recollection of some of the avoidable pitfalls that defined the outgoing administration and the reason it would be ending its tenure with an inauspicious legacy. As it may be recalled, at inception, the outgo­ing administration started picking and choosing the court orders to obey or discountenance. The last of which is the naira redesign and Supreme Court order to allow both old and new currencies to remain legal tender pari passu till the end of the year which most analysts aver was initially snubbed by the authorities until the past couple of weeks. It is also worth refreshing our memory about how the executive arm also elected to keep med­dling in who became the leader of the legislature and head of the judiciary which are the two other arms of government that are ideally supposed to be separate from each other and which form the tripod with the executive as the third arm that serves as the bedrock of democracy. Under the outgoing regime, the three arms of government that are designed to be independent of each other, which is the universal best prac­tice and hallmark of democracy, has appeared in the past eight (8) years to have blended into one, which is against the letter and spirit of democ­racy— government of the people, by the people and for the people. That is because the lines separating the three (3) branches were intentionally being blurred through the meddlesome actions of the executive arm since 2015 when the ruling APC took control of Aso Rock Villa. The invasion of the other arms of govern­ment by the executive branch was witnessed in the epic battle to remove Senator Bukola Saraki, who became Senate President in 2015 contrary to the plans of the ruling party at the centre, APC, resulting in bitter court battles including the Senate President Saraki being put in the dock in law court over allegations of being behind armed robbery. There was also the abrupt removal of Justice Walter Onoghen as Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, under controversial circumstances just before the 2019 general elections. The sacking of the CJN was carried out after the judiciary was accused of being hostile to the executive arm and some judges, including Su­preme Court justices, were arrested in an early morning sting operation by security agencies leading to some of them being taken into custo­dy in their sleeping wears for allegedly being in possession of some foreign currencies that were found in their homes after a search by security operatives. By and large, apart from the unprecedented rise in the cost of living as reflected by the astro­nomical price of a pot of jollof rice and a loaf of bread currently causing great agony to a critical mass of our compatriots, it is the violation of those democracy ethos that is the culprit in the setting-off of the alarm bells in the minds of Ni­gerians that laid the foundation for the negative perception that has trailed the outgoing regime from inception to its fast approaching exit date of May 29 which is more or less in one month time. The encouraging news is that there would be a reversal of the obnoxious culture of trampling on the rule of law by the incoming administra­tion as I have been reliably informed that under President-elect, Bola Tinubu’s watch, such impu­nity or travesty of the rule of law would not be allowed to thrive. That is simply because the ex-Lagos State gov­ernor, Tinubu, is a dye-in-wool democrat. So, as opposed to acting in the manner that past leaders like ex-military dictators who lat­er became leaders in democratic settings such as ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo (1999-2007) and soon to be ex-President Muhammadu Buhari (2015-2023) that discountenanced and denigrat­ed the ethos of democracy by not respecting the principle of rule of law and separation of power, which are the bulwark of democracy, the days of impunity that have so badly eroded democ­racy in our nation may be on track to becoming history to be read only in books and archives by our children and not to be witnessed anymore by our generation. That belief is underscored by the fact that the military orientation of the aforementioned past presidents of Nigeria contrasts with the pedi­gree of the ex-Lagos State governor, APC national leader, and currently President-elect, Bola Tinu­bu’s democratic credentials. And it is evidenced by his being the arrow­head for the struggle for the return of democra­cy in the country through National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) in the dark days of military rule in Nigeria, especially under the one nick­named the ‘googled one’, General Sani Abacha, who was head of state of our beloved country from 1993-1998. It is on record that it is the battle for the return of democracy to Nigeria which finally manifest­ed in 1999 and of which Asiwaju Tinubu was a prime executor that has helped to put him in the best position to help steer our country back to the path of true and liberal democracy that Nigeri­ans have been craving. Also, in light of the experience gathered and the sagacity he exhibited during the struggle for the return of democracy, there are very likely chances that the President-elect, Tinubu, might have scooped the presidency in the 2023 general elections by deploying his widely acknowledged ingenuity of thinking critically, planning rigor­ously and implementing meticulously towards accomplishing his quest for the presidency of which he has rich antecedents in swaying people to join in his cause. Although the non-transparent manner in which the election results was finally collated and announced by the Independent National Elec­toral Commission, INEC, has cast some doubts on the veracity of the number of votes cast and garnered by the contestants and integrity of elec­tions 2023, most Nigerians appear to have elected to eschew the dog-in-a-manger attitude which a vocal minority had adopted. The ensuing tranquil attitude highlighted above, needs to be emphasized as being owed to the good tidings issuing from the mouths of re­spected traditional, cultural and faith leaders in our country, to the effect that stakeholders should allow peace to prevail in the spirit of the current season of love being observed by both Christians and Muslims alike. Be that as it may, it is not for nothing that the President-elect, Tinubu, had been branded one of Nigeria’s most outstanding political strategists of our time when he literally pulled the rabbit out of a hat through the pivotal role that he played in the emergence of President Buhari as the winner of the presidential election in 2015.
