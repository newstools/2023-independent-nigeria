The Red Devils need two wins from their final three games to secure a place in the top four, although rivals Liverpool currently sit just one point behind and will be looking to leapfrog United if they do slip up. Bournemouth, who recently ensured their top flight survival, will undoubtedly provide a stern test for United on Saturday. In the meantime, though, it appears that United have been quoted a huge sum for one of their top transfer targets. As per Football Insider, Inter Milan will demand £69.5 million for striker Lautaro Martinez. The Argentina international is reportedly a target for both United and Chelsea this summer, but the striker won’t come cheap. Martinez, 25, joined Inter from Argentinian side Racing Club in 2018 and has since made more than 230 appearances for his current side. This season, he has netted 25 goals and provided 10 assists in 52 matches across all competitions, including the only goal of the game during Inter’s 1-0 Champions League semi-final second leg win over rivals AC Milan on Tuesday. The report claims that both the Blues and United are interested in Martinez as they look to add a proven goalscorer to their respective squads. POLL Only three teams have scored fewer goals than Chelsea in the Premier League so far this term, and incoming manager Mauricio Pochettino is said to be a huge fan of Martinez. United, meanwhile, are set to be in the market for a new striker with loanee Wout Weghorst set to return to parent club Burnley at the end of the current season. Despite the interest from both Chelsea and United, Martinez is contracted to his current club until the summer of 2026 and inter are therefore under very little pressure to sell him this summer.
