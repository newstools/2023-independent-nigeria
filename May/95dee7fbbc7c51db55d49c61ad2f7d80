Nigerian chef Hilda Bassey Effiong, known as Hilda Baci, has extended her cooking to 100 hours to break the Guinness World Record for longest cooking hours. Hilda made a historic feat on Monday, May 15, 2023, after she broke the Guinness World Record for the longest cooking time by an individual. Announcing her marathon cooking challenge extension from 96 to 100 hrs in an Instagram post on Monday afternoon, Baci’s best friend @ama_reginald wrote: ”’Let’s go. I asked my baby to make it a round figure, so we are doing 100hrs.” Baci started her cooking marathon challenge four days ago at Amore Gardens. She will keep cooking to extend the record until the 100th hour.
