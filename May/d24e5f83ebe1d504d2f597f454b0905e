The National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has demanded the screening and confirmation of nominees for the board of the North East Development Commission (NEDC) as forwarded by President Muhammadu Buhari to the Senate earlier this month. The Vice President of the NYCN, Amb. Akoshile Mukhtar made this demand at a press conference in Abuja. He said Nigerians are not unaware of the behind the scene scheming by certain interests to halt the process, adding that it must be made clear that governance is a continuum that never ends and is governed by laws, which the President’s nomination of the board members followed. “The leadership of the NYCN has followed the process since the forwarded the nominees to the Senate and has carried out due diligence on the nominees. The board nominated by President is comprised of Nigerians with solid track records and a balanced representation of the youth demography, including the nominee for managing director of the NEDC. “The diversity of the board in terms of demography, geography and ethnicity is not in doubt and it is the strong opinion of the NYCN that they should be considered by the Senate in their merit for appointment by the President is soon as possible. “Governance never ends and doesn’t wait, just as the severe humanitarian need and exigencies that necessitated the creation of the NEDC isn’t going to pause and wait for the interests of some individuals to be satisfied before continuing to bite the people of the North East. “While we have written to the Senate to make our demands, we are equally calling on all well meaning Nigerians to make same demand on the Senate for succor to return to the people of the North East region.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “All Nigerians will not have the required development if some Nigerians are left in crisis and not given the solid footing required to be reintegrated into their normal lives as it is the case in the north east geopolitical zone,” NYCN said.
