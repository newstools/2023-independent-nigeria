Abubakar Yalleman’s sacrifice signalled the close of ranks by the North West caucuses to clinch the Speakership already allotted to the zone by the leadership of the ruling party.

Yalleman who spoke with newsmen in Kano on Monday said that he was “very comfortable with the decision of the All Progressive Congress that finally zoned Speakership to NW with Abbas in mind” The soft-spoken Jigawa state federal lawmaker was asked whether he would step down for Tajudeen Abbas, and he replied in the affirmative, “Yes why not?” Yalleman who had fought for his party to zone the position to the North West region of Nigeriaexplained further that his decision and sacrifice were rooted in “Party is supremacy”. Jigawa state’s biggest export into the Speakership race of the 10th National Assembly, Abubakar Makki Yalleman had a couple of weeks ago told the world that his home state, Jigawa deserves to produce the next Speaker of the House of Representatives in the light of its contribution to APC’s victory in the just concluded 2023 General elections‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Yalleman said “In the recent history of participatory democracy in Nigeria, Kano, Katsina, and Sokoto states from Northwest Nigeria have all produced the leadership of the 360-man National Assembly.

Yalleman stressed: “I have made it clear, that I’m not a surrogate in the race, I believe in my ability, and capacity to lead the 360-man Assembly, and I am in the race to win the trophy for Nigerian democracy.”
