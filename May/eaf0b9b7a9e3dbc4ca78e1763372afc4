KANO  – The Independent Hajj Re­porter (IHR), a Civil Soci­ety Organisation (CSO), has called for more secu­rity measures to be taken at airports and Hajj camps during this year’s exercise. The IHR is a media-relat­ed CSO that monitors and reports Hajj and Umrah ac­tivities within and outside Nigeria. Its National Coordinator, Ibrahim Muhammed, on Thursday, said in a statement that this would dissuade the perpetration of criminal activities in places where in­tending pilgrims would tran­sit from. He called on agencies re­sponsible for security across all departure centres to be up and doing to ensure the safe airlift of the pilgrims. The National Hajj Com­mission of Nigeria (NAH­CON) has fixed May 25 for the inaugural transportation of Nigerian intending pilgrims to Saudi Arabia. “Nigerians may recall that pilgrims from Niger State had to be ferried to Abuja because of security challenges in Min­na and inadequate security around Minna Airport. “Also, Kaduna-bound aircraft had to be diverted to Kano due to security con­cerns while a convoy of ve­hicles conveying intending pilgrims in Sokoto state was attacked by suspected bandits leading to the death of a secu­rity agent,” he said. Muhammed also said preparations for this year’s airlift are already being chal­lenged by the Sudanese con­flict and urged authorities to ensure that adequate security personnel is deployed to all de­parture centres. POLL He advised all State Mus­lim Pilgrims Welfare Boards and Agencies to borrow a cue from NAHCON by coming up with a standing committee on security with a mandate to en­sure full protection of all in­tending pilgrims and facilities being used for transit. “Various security outfits exist across all the states and local government areas and we believe that it will not take too much to select capable hands to work 24/7 until all pilgrims are airlift­ed.”
