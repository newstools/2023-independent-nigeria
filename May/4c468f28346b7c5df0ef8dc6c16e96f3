AWKA  – The Chairman Anambra State House of Assembly Committee on Transport, Hon. Patrick Obalum Udeoba, says the government will venture into water transport in coastal areas of the state. Obalum, who extolled Governor Soludo’s efforts on road infrastructure, said the government plans to explore its potential in coastal areas of Ihiala, Ayamelum and others to diversify the transport sector. Speaking with our correspondent exclusively, the lawmaker who represents Anambra-West State constituency in the outgoing legislature, opined that the government of Professor Chukwuma Soludo has restored sanity and orderliness in the transport sector of Anambra State. Udeoba noted that Soludo has chased touts and miscreants out of motor parks and has equally equipped and empowered Anambra State Road Traffic Management Agency (ARTMA) for better performance in traffic management and control. He said the governor has constituted a taskforce chasing touts and illegal revenue collectors selling tickets or collecting money from motorists, when the governor has publicly declared that no physical cash should be collected anywhere in the state as all official payment systems are digital.
