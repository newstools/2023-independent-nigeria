They recalled that political gladiators in Jos North LGA particularly the Jos North LGA INEC Electoral Officer collated and returned the results of the ward, even when the INEC officials of the ward went missing. “These and many more discredited gestures instigated the controversies that led to the avoidable, denial of our rights to cast votes in the critical elections.” According to them,'” This ad-hoc committee was formed in the interest of deepening the message of peace by asking for redressing of the injustice through pleading with the Plateau governorship/House of Assembly petition Tribunal for another chance to also participate in elections through a bye-election in the ward.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ They commended the setting up of the Plateau State Elections Petition Tribunal and believed that With the tribunal in place, there is a commitment and resolve to do justice to all those who are aggrieved because of one electoral issue or the other. POLL .“In Naraguta B Ward, we suffered utter disenfranchisement, for reasons that are not our making. Brazen electoral crimes and offences were unleashed on the entire Naraguta B Ward, as BVAS machines and allied electoral materials were either stolen or diverted to unknown destinations, to the effect that elections could not be conducted in the Ward, in spite of the zeal and readiness of the voting population to participate and exercise their constitutional right.” They added that for reasons not known to them, alien but certainly strong partisan forces took more than a passing interest in the election and voting in the Naraguta B Ward. ” These forces infiltrated the area and the voting centres and orchestrated hooliganism and brigandage to the extent that the atmosphere became chaotic and not conducive for free and fair elections. “ They demanded that In the spirit of fair play, equity, justice, and good conscience, they are pleading for the understanding of the tribunal order for a fresh conduct of the 2023 Gubernatorial and House of Assembly elections in the Naraguta B Ward.
