Manchester City forward Julian Alvarez has netted the 100th goal in all the matches played at Etihad Stadium of all competition this season. Alvarez provided the cutting edge in the absence of Erling Haaland with a clinical finish to put City ahead after 12 minutes against Chelsea. Their fans were thrown into jubilation as they basked in the warm sunshine waiting for the trophy presentations and celebrations. According to the BBC, Manchester City celebrated a third successive Premier League title triumph with victory over Chelsea in a relaxed party atmosphere at Etihad Stadium. City were confirmed as champions without even playing after Nottingham Forest’s win against Arsenal on Saturday, allowing manager Pep Guardiola to make nine changes from the side that thrashed Real Madrid to reach the Champions League final. Chelsea had some of the better chances as the game went on, with City’s deputy keeper Stefan Ortega saving from Raheem Sterling when clean through and Conor Gallagher heading against the post. Kalvin Phillips headed against the woodwork for City as they closed out another win in the relentless run that has brought them the title and the chance of a Treble, with the FA Cup final at Wembley and the Champions League final in Istanbul to come.
