Prominent Civil Rights Advo­cacy Group- Human Rights Writers Association of Nige­ria (HURIWA) has described as state-sponsored terrorism, the stoning to death for her Christian faith in Sokoto of the female Student of Shehu Shagari College of Education Miss Deborah Samuel Yakubu over a year ago. HURIWA said the Sokoto state government, the Nige­ria Police Force, Sokoto State command and the Sokoto State Directorate of the Department of State Services are acting in a well-written conspiratorial script to allow the suspected kill­ers of this innocent Niger State-born Christian girl killed in the broad daylight, to escape the so-called long arm of the law just as the Rights group expressed shock and disappointment that the Christian Association of Nigeria has forgotten about her case and are unconcerned about the brazen injustice being meted out to her family. Comrade Emmanuel Onwu­biko, the National Coordinator of the civil society organisation, said there is no known excuse why it has been one year after a female student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto State, Deborah (Samu­el) Yakubu, was killed by some extremist Muslim students over alleged blasphemy of the Islamic religion, and yet the Nigeria Police Force is saying that it is still on the trail of prime suspects culpable in the immolation. HURIWA recalled that the Police Public Relations Officer, Sokoto State Police Command, Abubakar Sanusi, confirmed the development during a tele­phone interview with a media reporter just as the deceased, a 200-level student was set ablaze on May 12, 2022, after she re­portedly advised her class­mates against posting religious contents on their department’s WhatsApp group which was created for academic purposes. The rights group recalled that a Video of Deborah being stoned, beaten with sticks and immolated by some of her Muslim colleagues, which was seen by our correspondent, was shared widely on all social me­dia platforms. HURIWA then wondered why it is taking an eternity for the so-called law enforcement agencies of the Police, the DSS, the Civil De­fence, the Nigerian Customs, and the Nigerian Immigration Services, to successfully track down the killers of Deborah who did this unthinkable brutal murderous act in the daylight in full view of the relevant securi­ty institutions aforementioned whose members present at her public stoning were armed but failed to save Deborah Samuel Yakubu from the murderous crowd only because she was a Christian.
