Delta State Government has urged Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL), to pay indigenous contractors to Itsekiri Regional Development Committee, IRDC, who have successfully executed jobs awarded to them to reasonable milestones, without commensurate payments, saying they do not like shutdowns of operations of any company. Prince Emmanuel Amgbaduba handed down the charge on Sunday, May 7, 2023, when he went to Omadino Community in Warri South Local Government Area, to inspect the 0.38km internal road executed by Itsekiri RDC in the oil and gas-rich Omadino. Prince Amgbaduba, who was conducted round the project by the Secretary of IRDC, Richard Omare Esq, Treasurer of IRDC, Mr. Emma Adun, and the Engineer in charge of the company executing the project, asserted that the job has been done to appreciable milestones, without payment done as agreed between Chevron, IRDC and the contractors. Whilst describing the 380 meters road project connecting Nenuwa Hall, Omadino, as a complete job, the Commissioner, advised the management of Chevron Nigeria Limited to do the needful in less than 10 days to avoid unrest, due to the ultimatum handed down by the aggrieved indigenous IRDC contractors. He said the road project “is of a very good standard with two-side drains” and encouraged other community development organisations to embark on similar projects. IRDC Secretary, Richard Omare., who also addressed newsmen after the on-the-spot assessment, disclosed that clusters of houses between 70 and 80 percent completion stages as well as an ultra-modern civic centre are also being constructed in Omadino by Itsekiri RDC. The IRDC Scribe, who stated that Chevron only did one milestone payment sometime in December 2022, mentioned a series of housing units, totaling 103, markets and cottage hospitals as some of the projects being constructed by Itsekiri RDC at different stages of completion, which haven’t been paid for by the management of Chevron Nigeria Limited.
