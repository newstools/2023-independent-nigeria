ABUJA  – Abubakar Chika Adamu, former member of the House of Representatives who represented Shiroro/ Rafi/Munya Federal Con­stituency of Niger State in the 8th House has said that there are three arms of gov­ernment which is the Ex­ecutive, Legislative and the Judiciary, and on no ground should the executive say it has appointed the Chief Jus­tice of the Federation. The law allows him to nominate but after getting it from the National Judicial Council. In a live interview mon­itored on Arise TV, Hon. Chika Adamu said that the legislature is an independent body and they must choose among themselves, and neither the President nor the party have the right to dictate who should lead the National Assembly. According to him, “The National Assembly like any other arm of government is independent to decide who will lead as an arm of gov­ernment. “I don’t see any reason either the party or anyone will want to microzone or nanozone, there should be no reason one should try to microzone the Legislature. This is undemocratic and very dangerous to democracy and I don’t think this will fly. “I have been speaking about the injustice we have been having within the APC and it is not because I have an interest in Aliyu Betara but because I am speaking as a former Legislator who doesn’t want to see that arm of government being bas­tardized in dictatorship.” He described APC as be­ing cantankerous because of the advice that has been com­ing from so many quarters. “You can see even in terms of sharing the seats of the Legislature. How did you exclude the North Central, so I think it’s a biased thing, somebody just thinks I must make this person whether he is going to cover up for me.”  ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
