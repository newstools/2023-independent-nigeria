ABUJA – As the Chairman of the Economic and Finan­cial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mallam Abdulra­sheed Bawa, comes under scrutiny over corruption allegations, the Concerned Northern Forum (CNF) has reiterated its commitment to support him in the fight against corruption, urging him not to be distracted. Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State had accused Bawa of demanding a $2 mil­lion bribe from him, an allega­tion that has been dismissed by the commission. The CNF, in a statement on Monday by its chairman, Muhammad Sanni, in Abuja, said the various allegations of corruption against the EFCC boss were “absurd, planned and executed by certain corrupt individuals to smear the chairman of the commission and distract him from fighting against corrup­tion and other related finan­cial crimes.” Sanni insisted that the “al­legations are not true, lack evidence, mostly twisted to misinform the general pub­lic,” and “circulated around by those who are afraid the eagle eyes of the EFCC are coming for them over embez­zlement and misuse of public funds.” According to Sanni, Ma­tawalle’s was without substance, “otherwise he would have provided sup­porting evidence for his allegations. “No evidence is presented because it is fabricated, a con­coction, and an effort by Ma­tawalle to divert the attention of the public from the ongoing investigation on him over alle­gations of corruption, award of phantom contracts and diversion of over N70 billion. This is a known strategy by corrupt individuals to avoid a date with the law.” On Bawa’s hajj to Mecca, the CNF chairman argued that it was not against public service rule, and given that Bawa was financially capable of sponsoring the trip without any compromise with respect to his job, it shouldn’t be an issue.
