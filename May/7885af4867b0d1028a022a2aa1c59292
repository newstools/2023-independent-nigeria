Mr. Godwin Obaseki, the Edo State Governor, has mourned the passing of the founder of DAAR Communications, Chief Raymond Dokpesi, describing him as the “pioneer of private broadcast media in Nigeria.” In a statement, the governor said Chief Dopkesi was an il­lustrious son of Edo State, who recorded indelible achievements that marked him out as one of Nigeria’s most impactful media executives. According to him, “The Ezo­mo of Weppa-Wanno, Chief Dokpesi was an outstanding busi­nessman and indeed, a media mogul, who took the bold step to venture into private broadcasting and broke the ground for many who came after him. “He was a pacesetter and brave in his quest to build Afri­ca’s most enterprising, private broadcasting brand. “Chief Dokpesi was a man of many parts. From his early ac­ademic exploits as a scholar in Poland, he returned to Nigeria to establish himself as an expert in the shipping business. He set up Nigeria’s first shipping line before venturing into broadcast­ing upon the deregulation of the media business in the country.”
