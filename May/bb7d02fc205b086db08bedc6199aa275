Gunmen have reportedly abducted a lady identified as Benifica Haruna in the early hours of Tuesday in Fadan Ikulu Chiefdom, Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State. It was gathered that the kidnappers invaded the area and started shooting sporadically to scare people away. The mother of the victim, Sarauniyan Ikulu, who confirmed the abduction told Daily Post that her daughter was in her room when they heard gunshots. The mother said, “My daughter called me that she was going to hide somewhere in the house, unknown to us, we were their target. They (kidnappers) succeeded in taking my daughter away.” She added that the kidnappers came on vehicles and motorcycles and freely operated for almost two hours without the intervention of security personnel. She however appealed to the security agencies to ensure that her daughter was rescued. Meanwhile, the Kaduna Police Public Relations Officer DSP Muhammed Jalige is yet to confirm the incident.
