LAGOS – Eze Okechukwu Anorue, the Babaloja Tejuosho Ultra-modern Market Phase 2, Yaba, Lagos State, has condemned Nzuko Ndigbo Di Na Ala Lagos for calling on Igbo people to shut down markets in the state beginning on May 3. In an interview with Daily Independent on Sunday, he stated that the group is not known to the Igbo community in the state, adding that it did not have the mandate of the people to speak on their behalf. The group complained that Igbo people were persecuted, and discriminated against before, during, and after the recent elections in the state. Nzuko Ndigbo Di Na Ala Lagos also alleged that some Igbo people were killed during the elections and shops burnt in the markets in the state. The group also called on Igbo people in the state not to participate in the planned census, because, according to it, Igbo people were not allowed to exercise their voting rights. However, Eze Anorue, who is also the Eze-Igbo 1 of Igbogbo/Baiyeku LCDA in Lagos State, described the allegations as false, adding that courts of competent jurisdiction were handling matters relating to the elections. He called on Igbo people in the state to remain calm and go about their lawful duties.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ According to him, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu is friendly to the Igbo people and will continue to protect their interests.
