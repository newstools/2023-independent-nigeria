Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke has dissolved the Governing Council of Osun State University, Osogbo. Mallam Yusuf Alli-led board of the university was appointed by ex governor, Rauf Aregbesola in 2016 and was reappointed by the immediate past governor, Adegboyega Oyetola after it completed its first 5-year tenure. But a press release signed by the State Head of Service, A. Aina, dated May 19, said Adeleke has approved the dissolution of the institution’s Governing Council. The letter partly reads, “The Governor of Osun State, Senator Demola Jackson Nurudeen Adeleke, has approved the dissolution of the Governing Council of Osun State University with immediate effect. “While thanking the Council members for their selfless service and commitment to the University, the governor equally appreciates them immensely for their contributions to the development of the University in particular and the State at large and wishes them the best in their future endeavours.”
