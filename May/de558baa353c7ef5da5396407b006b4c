As controversy continues to trail the zoning arrangement for the headship of the 10th National Assembly, by the All Progressives Congress (APC), a youth group in the party, APC Youth Alliance For Progress, APC-YAP, has called on the party and the president-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to heed the progressive and patriotic advice of some leaders of the party to jettison the present zoning arrangement. The APC-YAP in a statement on Sunday in Abuja stressed that ignoring the well-meaning advice of prominent stakeholders like the governor of Ondo state, Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, was a recipe for a fractured National Assembly, especially the House of Reps. Governor Akeredolu had in a statement titled, “Proposed APC Zoning Formula for NASS Leadership Positions is a Skewed Arrangement that Reinforces Injustice And Enhances Inequity,” noted with great concern that the purported zoning arrangement released by the party “represents early signs of steps aimed at attempts to cabin the hard-earned presidency for our leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, by a few individuals with eyes on Aso Rock Power Buttons.” The youth group statement signed by Isa Pai and Wahab Adeyemi noted that it “stands logic on the head for the party to reward indolence and perpetrate injustice at a time for inclusion and national healing. It is urgent for the party to discard the notion of handpicking officers for the 10th House of Reps., Nigerians are already wary of the party and no attempt should be made to reinforce the idea that the party does not care about party development and democracy.” Referencing the Ondo governor, the APC-YAP wondered why the party that allowed an open field in the presidential primaries will now micro zone offices for the National Assembly as if it was a department of the party. Akeredolu had stated, “It is an insidious permutation that North-east will be deprived in the face of the unsavoury generosity dispensed through two slots to a particular geo-political zone. It is self-repudiating for one to argue, therefore, that the Speaker of the House of Representatives cannot also emerge from the North-east.”
