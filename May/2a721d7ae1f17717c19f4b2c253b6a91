LAGOS  – The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), has promised to create enabling environment for the growth of the nation’s gas industry. Engr Farouk Ahmed, the Authority Chief Executive (ACE),who disclosed this at a recent stakeholders’ engagement on gas utilisation in Nigeria, said that the 12 regulations recently gazetted will unlock the golden opportunities and signpost the pathway to energy security. He said policy frameworks such as the National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP), the Decade of Gas Programme (DOGP) and the establishment of the Midstream and Downstream Gas Infrastructure Fund by the Authority to catalyse gas investments are yielding significant results. He implored collaborations and interventions amongst stakeholders that are needed to improve domestic gas utilisation in the country. He explained that the engagement seeks to encourage large consumers of petroleum products to not only operate within the regulatory space, but also to become aware of the comparative advantages between the different fuels particularly gas which has been designated as Nigeria’s transition fuel. Kalu Ukoha, the Executive Director, Distribution System, Storage and Retailing Infrastructure (DSSRI),while speaking, said some of the invited institutions have been identified as operating outside the regulatory oversight which is not in consonant with the Petroleum Industry Act (2021). “This engagement sets the objective to enlighten this end-user category on the need to urgently obtain the requisite petroleum storage license and to engender the transition from white products to gas at the last mile. “The Authority’s twelve gazetted regulations define the licensing regimes, procedures and standards for handling petroleum products which when breached pose increased risks. In addition, gas as the transition fuel represents a cleaner and more cost-effective energy source,” he said. POLL He also hinted that the Authority encourages operators and businesses to take advantage of the evolving opportunities in the gas value chain for sustainable business growth by positioning their energy needs to embrace gas derivatives such as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Autogas, propane and butane to hedge against future global uncertainties to diesel supply. He advocated the need for the support and collaboration of operators and businesses to achieve a safer and cheaper energy operating environment, “the Authority accordingly appeals to all petroleum handlers to fully comply with the provisions of the PIA and NMDPRA regulations and thereby avoiding strong regulatory enforcement which may adversely impact on business operations. The Authority’s statutory mandate remains to enable industry growth.” [5/7, 1:55 PM] Mohammed Shosanya: Report Sees Reduction In Africa’s Oil Output GlobalData report has predicted decrease in Africa’s annual crude oil and condensate by a Compound Annual Growth Rate, CAGR of 8.78 per cent to reach 2.86 million barrels per day, mmbpd.
