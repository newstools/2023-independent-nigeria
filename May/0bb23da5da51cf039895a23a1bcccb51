The World Health Organisation has said that COVID-19 is no longer a global public health emergency. It could be recalled that on January 20, 2020, WHO declared COVID a public health emergency of international concern. The Director General of WHO, Tedros Ghebreyesus, disclosed this while speaking at a media conference on Friday, saying that the global health body’s international health regulations emergency committee made the decision at its 15th meeting on Thursday. “Yesterday, the Emergency Committee met for the 15th time and recommended to me that I declare an end to the public health emergency of international concern. I’ve accepted that advice. It’s therefore with great hope that I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency,” Ghebreyesus said.
