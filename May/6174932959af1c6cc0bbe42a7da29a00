Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has made a ‘bizarre’ decision by allowing Richard Arnold to visit the dressing room after matches. The Red Devils supremo replaced Ed Woodward last year. And while he seems to be more popular than his predecessor among supporters, his long-term future is up in the air as takeover talk continues to surround the club. It recently emerged that Ten Hag had reinstated a Sir Alex Ferguson tradition by allowing club directors to visit the dressing room after matches. But football finance expert Kieran Maguire, speaking to Football Insider, has branded that decision as ‘bizarre’. “I’ve always taken the view that a dressing room is sacrosanct and what happens in the dressing room stays there,” he said. “That comes from playing sports myself at an amateur level. “As soon as an outsider enters the dressing room the environment completely changes. “Having said that, we are seeing more and more intrusion pre and post-match into the privacy of players and managers. “I’m a great believer in keeping the magic, magic. POLL “The idea of Richard Arnold – an investment banker – being brought into the dressing room at Old Trafford is bizarre.” Ten Hag relies on Arnold at Old Trafford, even if the United chief keeps himself away from footballing matters. And there’s a possibility the 52-year-old will leave the club should a takeover go through. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has his own trusted circle that he’d want at United should INEOS steal a march. And there have been suggestions Sheikh Jassim will look to overhaul the Red Devils behind the scenes should his own takeover bid be successful.
