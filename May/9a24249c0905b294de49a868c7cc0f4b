DAMATURU  – The Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD) has described the use of non-kinetic methods among others as key to elimi­nating the Boko Haram insur­gency in Northeast Nigeria. The Executive Director of the CITAD, Yunusa Zakari Ya’u, disclosed this at a me­dia briefing and presentation of a 227 page book on “Boko Haram’s Community Percep­tion of Dialogue and Reconcil­iation in Northern Nigeria ”. Ya’u revealed that, three out of the seven chapter book, x-ray and discussed a dialogue conducted in the Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states in the last 12 years of the Boko Haram Insurgency. “This book is not only after ending the battle but also to re­store peace, because there are wider spectrums of stakehold­ers that need to be established. The three chapters of the books looked at the previous dia­logues conducted in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states. “Also one of the chapters deals with the specific experi­ence of non-kinetic response in Kano state which looked at lessons and negotiations, therefore I believe the use of non-kinetic methods is still relevant in ending the con­flict,” he revealed. According to the CITAD Executive Director, women and girls consist of the largest victims of the Boko Haram Insurgency, because many of them were abducted, kid­napped or forced to perform suicide attacks.
