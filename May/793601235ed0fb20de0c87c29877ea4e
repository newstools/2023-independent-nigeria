According to Kebbi state NFF chairman, Abubakar AC Ladan the march played was to elevate the club from the Nigerian pro league to Super 8 which must be decided between them and Kano pillars who are both contenders for the title. The march which was a 1-1 draw has given the visitors an edge over the host who should have won to add up points and increase their chances of qualifying. Ladan added that all hope is not lost as Kebbi United hopes to win its next march at Malunfashi while Kano Pillars will play Sokoto United in Kano which will be the decider “Our team outplayed Kano Pillars. We only lack finishers we could have won the march but it’s fine we have a good team much younger than Kano pillars and we shall get there hopefully he said. Reaçting to the rumour that Kano Pillars declined to play in the FIFA Stadium in Kebbi due to a lack of security wire, he said the stadium is yet to be handed over to NFF Kebbi is still in the hands of the contractor, therefore, won’t attempt to play inside it. While describing the support of Kebbi state as encouraging he charged the team to remain focused and dedicated in the field as they play their next march at Katsina State,he also thanked the state for free tickets which boosted the morale of the players on the pitch.
