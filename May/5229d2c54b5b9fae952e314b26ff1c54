Civil rights advocacy group, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) on Thursday asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to tell Nigerians the outcome of its corruption investigation involving former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs and ex-governor of oil-rich Akwa Ibom, Godswill Akpabio. HURIWA, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, expressed disappointment that despite the multiple allegations of heists of public money hanging around Akpabio, the ruling All Progressives Congress found him fit as its preferred choice for the position of Senate President ahead of the inauguration of the 10th National Assembly in June. The group recalled that weeks ago, the EFCC asked Akpabio to turn himself in over corruption investigation but has suddenly gone mute since the politicking for the national positions of the 10th Assembly began. The EFCC asked Akpabio to “personally report” to the anti-graft agency on May 9. This was after the Senator shunned previous summons by the anti-graft agency in March and April. It said the EFCC had begun a probe into the alleged theft of N108.1 billion of Akwa Ibom State funds, adding the EFCC had detained Akpabio over the alleged fraud but later freed him. However, the anti-graft commission reopened Akpabio’s file as governor and minister weeks ago, invited him but kept mum despite that the Senate President hopeful did not honour the invitation by the anti-graft commission.
