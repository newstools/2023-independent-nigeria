Cadbury Nigeria Plc started the 2023 business year on a strong note with net profit rising by 124 per cent on the back of double-digit growth in sales. The interim report for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023 showed profit of N3.435 billion for the first quarter 2023, a growth of 124 percent on N1.54 billion recorded in similar period in 2022.

Mrs. Oyeyimika Adeboye, Managing Director, Cadbury Nigeria Plc, said the company’s performance in the first quarter of the year attested to its resilience that has enabled it to navigate through the challenging business environment. “Businesses in Nigeria faced significant economic headwinds in the first three months of the year, which was characterised by tension generated in the build-up to the 2023 general elections, nationwide scarcity of cash caused by naira redesign, persistent Naira devaluation, and difficulty in accessing FX. These significantly impacted on the cost of doing business in the country. “Despite the challenging operating environment, we remain committed to delivering superior value to our stakeholders. As a company, we also understand the need to nourish and delight our consumers with the right snacks and we will continue to do what is right for our environment,” Adeboye stated.
