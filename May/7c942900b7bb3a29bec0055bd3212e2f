Delta State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa has rendered an unreserved apology to Delta Ijaw for his administrationâ€™s failure to complete the Ayakoromo bridge project after 8 years just as he tasked the incoming Governor, Rt. Hon Sheriff Oborevwori to mobilise the contractor to site. Speaking at the Valedictory Dinner Night in Asaba yesterday, organized in honour of the outgoing government, Okowa noted that the previous construction company, ZEROCK slowed down the pace of work despite the government was meeting up to financial demands. In view of the above, the state government terminated the contract with ZEROCK and re-awarded it to SETRACO Nig. Ltd. with an upward review as approved. Speaking further at the Valedictory Dinner Night, Okowa said an initial sum of #2bn has been paid to SETRACO with plans on top gear with the incoming government to pay another #2bn, making it #4bn to mobilize contractor to site by next week. In strong terms, Okowa called on the incoming administration, Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori, governor-elect and his team to implore dedicated measures to ensure the completion of the Ayakoromo bridge. However, the Ayakoromo bridge would have been a very key achievement of his two terms as governor of the state because if completed, it will connect some parts of Burutu local government communities with four other local governments with internal roads which will also make easy and improve the economic activities of the riverine dwellers. A week from today, precisely on May 29, a new government will be sworn in to take charge of the state governance.
