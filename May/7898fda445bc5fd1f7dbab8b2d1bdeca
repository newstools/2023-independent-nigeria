Sterling One Foundation is pleased to announce that it will collaborate with corporate and development partners to host the second edition of the Africa Social Impact Summit (ASIS) between the 10th and 11th of August 2023, in Lagos, Nigeria. Following the successful implementation of some of the solutions put forward to tackle key African challenges at the inaugural edition, the Foundation and its partners are excited to reconvene African leaders and development experts across the government, public, private, and civil society sectors to share progress insights and knowledge and further spur impact investment for more sustainable solutions. Launched in 2022, the Africa Social Impact Summit (ASIS) represents a direct action toward the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in Africa through the effective collaboration of all key players within the African development ecosystem to achieve market-led solutions for the growth of the continent,favorablee policies that support them, and investments that help them scale. The Summit hosted over 3,000 delegates from 66 countries and had 13 entrepreneurs from 4 African countries pitch at the Deal Room. While delivering his keynote address at the maiden edition of the Summit, the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Matthias Schmale, highlighted the need for Africa to eagerly begin to focus more attention on the most vulnerable in society as they are the most hit by the growing unemployment, spiraling inflation, climate change and insufficient access to quality education and health services. This concern and similar concerns raised by key experts and thought leaders present at the inaugural Summit led to the selection of a central theme for this year’s edition, “Global Vision, Local Action: Repositioning The African Development Ecosystem For Sustainable Outcomes”, which focuses on tactics to improve on what African innovators are currently doing, and finding ways to make impact investment on the continent more catalytic and scalable.
