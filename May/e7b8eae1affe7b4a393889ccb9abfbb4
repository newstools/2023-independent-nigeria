LAGOS – The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA), has stated that the current approach of paying to the supplier and waiting for the supplier to remit and upload on TaxPro Max is counter-productive to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and Taxpayers, adding that it will further portray Nigeria as an inhospitable environment to do business. Mr. Adewale-Smatt Oyerinde, NECA’s Director General, in chats with Daily Independent, cautioned the FIRS on the recent update implemented by it on its TaxProMax platform as it will have adverse negative impact on organised businesses. He said: “As you are well aware, organised businesses have been faced with multi-dimensional challenges in recent time and in our view, policies and programmes of Government or its agencies should, ordinarily promote enterprise sustainability and competitiveness. However, the recent policy by the FIRS seems to negate Government Ease-of-Doing-Business efforts, places unnecessary administrative burden on businesses. “The policy is tantamount to the FIRS abdicating its responsibility to collect VAT from suppliers, and also lacks any legal foundation to impose additional burden on purchasers of raw materials and retailers in view of Section 15(1) and Section 17 of the VAT Act, among others “Though we note the FIRS efforts at creating awareness on the new policy through a Stakeholders’ engagement, we wish to state that the effort was vexatious and belated as the engagement should have preceded the implementation of the Policy. “Furthermore, we view the belated enlightenment as an attempt to confer legality on an otherwise illegal issue. “Where the objective of the FIRS is to ensure input VAT claimed by purchasers is remitted by suppliers, the FIRS may appoint purchasers as Agents of collection whereby they pay the VAT charged by suppliers directly to the FIRS and claim the corresponding input of VAT. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “We are open to further engagement on this issue; however, we request an immediate reversal of the Policy pending the amicable resolution of the challenges inherent in it and the establishment POLL Recall that NECA is the umbrella Association of private sector organizations in Nigeria. It was formed in 1957 to create a platform for Government to interact with organized businesses, host communities and the international community
