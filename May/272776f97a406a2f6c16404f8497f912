The Ikeja branch of the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) recent­ly embarked on a road walk on Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way through Ikeja GRA to mark the 2023 edition of the World Day for Safety and Health at work. According to the Man­ager, NSITF, Ikeja branch, Mrs. Opeyemi Adekoya, the theme of this year edition, ‘A Safe and Healthy working Environment is a funda­mental principle and right at work’, was apt, more so that it captured the main role of her agency in the so­ciety, which she described as promoting the enforcement of occupational safety and health standard in the work place. She emphasised that her agency attached great impor­tance to ensuring the reha­bilitation of employees who suffer work related injuries, occupational diseases or dis­abilities, as well as the provi­sion of a fair guaranteed and adequate compensation for all insured employees. The NSITF boss, howev­er, explained that the branch decided to embark on a road walk to celebrate the 2023 edition of the event with the understanding that it would not only create necessary awareness on how to pre­vent or reduce the number of work-related deaths and injuries, which happened to be a fundamental principle and right at Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund, but to also to improve the staff ’s fitness. According to her, the road walk exercise was able to in­crease the staff ’s cardiovas­cular fitness, strengthened their bones, ensured the reduction of excess body fat and boosted their muscle power and endurance. “We chose to do a road walk bearing in mind the health benefits of such exercise, which include improved management of conditions such as hyper­tension, high cholesterol, joint and muscular pains or stiffness and diabetes, as well as increased cardio­vascular and pulmonary fitness,” she stressed.
