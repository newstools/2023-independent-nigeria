Federico Dimarco and Romelu Lukaku struck as Inter Milan beat AS Roma 2-0 to restore their spot in Serie A’s top four.Dimarco was in the right place at the right time to tap home Denzel Dumfries’ cross from close range to give Inter a first-half lead.As Roma began to chase the game, substitute Lautaro Martinez found Lukaku, who powerfully steered a low strike to the left of Rui Patricio to seal the three points. The win for Simone Inzaghi’s side lifts them back above AC Milan and into the Champions League spots after Milan had temporarily taken charge of fourth spot with a win earlier on Saturday.Roma remain seventh but are still within touching distance of a European finish.Inter came out of a scrappy first half a goal to the good thanks to an instinctive Dimarco strike.Dumfries spotted Lukaku making a run into the penalty area and despite the striker’s attempt to slide in and poke the ball fizzing across the six-yard box toward goal, he couldn’t reach it, but Dimarco arrived at the back post just in time to tap past Rui Patricio.Roma had a strong appeal for a penalty in the second half denied when Dimarco slid in for a challenge and made contact with the ball before it popped up and struck his arm.After a quick VAR check, the referee’s decision not to give a penalty remained. Roma started to throw everything at Inter in search of an equaliser, but that’s when Inter capitalised and took the opportunity to stretch their advantage.Martinez slotted the ball to Lukaku who was through on goal, and without thinking about it, guided a low shot with force beyond Patricio with the inside of his left foot.That was the final nail in the coffin for Roma, who were unable to get back in the game.
