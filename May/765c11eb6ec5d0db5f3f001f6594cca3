He said there will be much collaboration between the state and federal government, especially in the area of mari­time economy, saying that the incoming government will take advantage of the sea­ports in the State to develop and grow the state economy. “But there have been spe­cific pronouncements con­cerning trying to encourage economic activities at the seaport. We are going to li­aise with the federal govern­ment to ensure the growth of the economy through the seaport is exclusively on the federal government list but what the incoming governor has said was that there will be much collaboration between the State and the federal gov­ernment to ensure a more eco­nomically viable state” “There will also be a focus on infrastructural and agri­cultural development that will encourage small-scale businesses.

Those are some of the specifics he has spoken about that can help grow the State,” he said. Finebone pointed out that the incoming governor will bring to bear his expertise as a financial manager to ensure sound financial management adding that the public sector is going to see a lot of revamp­ing.
