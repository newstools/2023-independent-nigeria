****Roots For Betare As HoR Speaker ****Laments Much Attention On Northwest In Speaker Selection ****Warns Governing Party Against Giving Yari Room To Contest Senate Presidency The governing All Progressives Congress (APC) has been commended for its decision to zone the top offices of the Senate and House of Representatives in a manner that “promotes unity, national cohesion and stability”. The party was also applauded for its choice of Senators Godswill Akpabio and Barau Jibril as the President of the Senate, and the Deputy President of the Senate respectively, as it urged the national leadership of the party to consider trying other zones besides the northwest for the speakership position of the House of Representatives. APC Chieftain and Coordinator, Northern Conscience for 2023, Garus Gololo, in an interview in Abuja on Monday, wondered why the party’s “National Working Committee (NWC) would be drawn into zoning the Speaker of the House of Representatives to the northwest considering that the region had produced same in 2003 and 2007 when Aminu Masari was the Speaker.The region also produced a Speaker in the person of Salisu Buhari and Aminu Tambuwal. So, is the northwest the only place in the north with the relevant capacity for the job can be found?” Gololo joined those drumming support for the lawmaker representing Biu/Bayo/Shani Federal Constituency of Borno state, Hon. Muktar Aliyu Betara, adding that “the APC should endorse those who can get the legislature to work with the incoming administration and deliver the dividends of democracy for Nigerians”.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ This is as he took a swipe at former Zamfara State governor, Abdullaziz Yari, over his intention to contest for the Senate President.The NCfor2023 National Coordinator accused Yari for being behind the APC’s dismal performance at the poll in the state, even as he insisted that the former governor was instrumental to the crisis that rocked the governing party under the leadership of Adam Oshiomole, as then national chairman of the party.He further maintained that Yari does not have the required legislative experience as a first time Senator to lead the Red Chamber. POLL “Yari is a first timer. Moreover, this is the same person who spoilt our party completely. As the Chairman of the Governors Forum, he refused to work with the party national chairman, Oshiomole. And even as the DG of Campaign for Bello Matawalle, the State Governor’s re-election bid, he made sure that Matawalle did not win.He should have written a letter of apology to the APC before even contesting on the platform”. He called on the incoming administration to put effective checks and balances to evaluate the performance of cabinet members.
