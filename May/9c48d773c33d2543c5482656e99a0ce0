MINNA  – The immediate past Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello was absent at the for­mal handing over to his succes­sor, Hon Mohammed Umar Bago. However, the erstwhile gover­nor delegated his Deputy, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso to perform the stat­utory functions. Former Governor Bello who was said to have disappeared from public glare on Sunday has been alleged to have left for an ‘unknown destination’ after the concluding part of the marathon State Executive Council (SEC) which lasted for three days. Bello, it was further learned, decided to make the wise choice of secretly leaving Niger State for fears of attacks from some aggrieved Nigerlites who had threatened to settle scores with him after office when he can no longer use state powers to intim­idate, oppress and suppress them. Meanwhile, Governor Umar Bago has taken the oath of office, warning political jobbers and all those whose closeness with him will impinge on his new respon­sibilities of providing selfless leadership in line with campaign promises to steer clear as it will not be business as usual. Governor Bago made the dec­laration at the Minna Trade Fair complex, the venue for his inau­guration, and assured the people of Nigerlites that the top on his agenda will be to work towards securing the lives and properties of the citizenry. “It is not going to be business as usual, but it is going to be busi­ness unusual for the betterment of the entire people of the state”, Bago said, adding however that the most compelling task before him is strategizing towards se­curing the lives and properties of Nigerlites.”
