Real Madrid legend Guti Haz has named Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe as the replacement for Karim Benzema. Real Madrid have returned with their interest in 24-year-old Kylian Mbappe, having missed out on him last summer. Mbappe was widely tipped to move to Santiago Bernabeu, but the French striker made a U-turn and signed a new three-year deal with the Parisians instead. Reports in Spain said that Los Blancos are set to reignite their interest in the 2018 World Cup winner, and Guti has given his opinion on the PSG frontman. He said the arrival of the former Monaco striker would lead to a very reduced role for veteran striker Benzema. He told El Chiringuito TV: “If Mbappé comes to Real Madrid, I would put him in the place of Benzema.” Benzema, 35, has reportedly signed a new one-year extension with Los Merengues, keeping him tied to the club till 2024.
