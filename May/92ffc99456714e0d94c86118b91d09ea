Manchester City are in ‘pole position’ to sign an Arsenal wonderkid to double the misery over dealt by the Citizens to the Gunners this season. The weekend’s action saw Pep Guardiola’s side trounce Everton 3-0 at Goodison Park, while Arsenal lost to Brighton & Hove Albion by the same scoreline. The results mean that Manchester City can seal a third title in a row against Chelsea next weekend – though another Arsenal loss first against Nottingham Forest would send the trophy to the Etihad early. And after a bruising season in which Mikel Arteta has come out second-best to his former mentor, rumours are now circling that he could be about to lose one of his most promising young stars to the relentless Eastlands outfit, too. According to Football Insider(opens in new tab), Manchester City are growing ever-confident about landing the precocious Ethan Nwaneri from the Gunners, with the teenager’s future in the balance. Nwaneri became the youngest Premier League footballer of all time when he appeared in the dying embers of the away victory at Brentford earlier this season. So young, in fact, was the 15-year-old that he had to get changed separately away from the rest of his team-mates.

Chelsea and City have both been linked with a move for Nwaneri since, who Gunners youth coach Jack Wilshere has branded “exceptional”(opens in new tab).‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ This might not be the only business conducted between City and Arsenal this summer.

POLL City lead the table by four points with a game in hand.
