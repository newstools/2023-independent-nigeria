BENIN – The Ambrose Alli University (AAU) Special Intervention Team set up by the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, to advance the government’s vision to reposition the institution to meet global standards, has unraveled N2bn tax fraud and other corrupt practices by the management and staff of the University. The team headed by the Managing Director of Schlumberger Nigeria Ltd, Mr. Andrew Olotu, while presenting its interim report at the Government House in Benin City, alleged massive certificate and transcript racketeering and other nefarious acts in the institution, calling for the urgent intervention of the government. Presenting the report on behalf of other members of the team, Mr. Austin Osakue, noted “Over N2 billion was owed the Edo State Government from the tax that was never paid to the state government. AAU receives more salaries compared to UNIBEN staff and they never pay taxes. “All the Internally Generated Revenues (IGRs) and school fees collected were not accounted for and all the money entered private pockets instead of the school purse. We have been able to check this excess and now are able to collect N32 million in taxes for the Edo State Government. “One of the biggest problems in AAU is overhead spending on diesel. Following the bad electricity situation in Ekpoma, the staff of the institution are cashing in on the situation to steal money from the treasury.” The team revealed that the issue of certificates and transcripts is a big business in AAU and has caused the University a bad image, adding “Students who graduated from 2019 to 2021 have not collected their certificates as there are people who collect money from students for this cause.” They further noted, “The SIT paid a loan of N330 million collected to pay salaries in 2021 and another N20 million which was meant for the purchase of special vehicles. Students pay heavily for projects. We have paid the April salaries of staff. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
