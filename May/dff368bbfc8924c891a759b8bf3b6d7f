ABUJA – Nigerians have been warned against moves to stop the inauguration of President-elect, Bola Tinubu, until the presidential election petition tribunal concludes hearing on suits challenging his victory at the February 25 presidential poll. This is as other well-meaning persons and the international community has been urged to wade into such clamour, stressing that it is heating up the polity. Dr Garus Gololo, an All Progressives Congress (APC) leader told DAILY INDEPENDENT on Thursday that the call to stop the inauguration until the end of the cases in the tribunal “was unwise and cannot be heeded by any rational being”. He said that “what is happening today happened during Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan’s time as presidents. “Buhari contested against these men, and in each of these cases, lost against them and was asked to go to court. But that did not stop their swearing-in as presidents. They were sworn in, while the cases continued in courts until the courts gave judgment on them”. To say at this point Tinubu should not be sworn in just because Peter Obi contested in the election is “unwell, unwise and illegal”. Gololo also expressed confidence that a federal government led by the former Lagos State governor “would rebuild the economy, revamp our ailing education sector and make Nigeria more purposeful and beneficial to me and you”. POLL He further called on President Muhammadu Buhari to mandate security agencies to investigate members of his cabinet before May 29. This he emphasized would help to reassure the public of his intentions for the 2023 elections. On allegations that the APC has moles within the Labour Party (LP) to destabilize and hurt its petition at the tribunal, Gololo challenged anyone with facts to present them. He explained that the “crisis in LP is self-inflicted and not the governing party’s making”.
