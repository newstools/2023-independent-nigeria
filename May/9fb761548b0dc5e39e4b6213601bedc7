Governor Hope Uzodimma’s leadership qualities were again brought to the fore at the weekend when the Igbo living in Rivers and Bayelsa states held a reception for him at the Presidential Hotel, Port Harcourt, where they reminded the governor that he is the shinning star of the Igbo nation known to them for now. According to Oguwike, the chief press secretary to Uzodimma, the Igbo living in the two states held a reception for Governor Uzodimma preceded yet another honour done him same day by the Government of Rivers State where he was awarded with the Grand Service Stars of Rivers State (GSSRS), the highest ever bestowed on individuals who have distinguished themselves in the service to society. Governor Nyesom Wike, himself a proud wearer of the GSSRS medal, decorated Governor Uzodimma with the award alongside seven other recipients at the Banquet hall, Government House, Port Harcourt. At the Presidential Hotel Port Harcourt, members of the United Igbo Community in Rivers and Bayelsa States drawn from six states – Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, Delta and Imo – spoke glowingly about the efforts Governor Uzodimma was making to bring the entire Igbo nation to national reckoning and urged him not to be deterred. They also delved into the governor’s activities in Imo State, recalling how much changes he has brought to the state within a short period in office. “We are happy to inform you that Igbo communities across the country share same positive sentiments on your achievements. The Igbo Community in Rivers State and Bayelsa State are proud of you and we thank you for the good work you are doing in the South East region. We thank you for your reintegration efforts towards bringing the Igbos into the nation’s platform,” a welcome address by Messrs Julius Uzoma (President General) and Chike Allison Ikwuagwu (Secretary General) of the group said. The group said they were not unmindful of the governor’s reelection come November 11, 2023, but assured him that they will not only vote for him but will galvanize support from every quarter to ensure that he retains his office to continue with the good job he is doing, but to also get better prepared for bigger services to the Igbo.
