Seun Kuti, the embattled son of the late Afrobeat king, Fela Kuti, has been released on bail on Tuesday night. Seun had been arrested and held in detention at the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, Lagos after a viral video showed how he slapped a police officer during an altercation on Third Mainland Bridge. He has been in custody since Monday, May 15, 2023. According to The Punch, it reported that the development was confirmed by his attorney, Adeyinka Olumide-Fusika, SAN, in a telephone interview with The Punch on Tuesday night. “Yes, Ṣeun Kuti was released minutes ago,” he said. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the Afrobeat musician may be released today (Tuesday) following the expiration of the extension of his remand in police custody, court documents obtained by The PUNCH revealed that the Chief Magistrate, Adeola Olatunbosun, extended Kuti’s remand until Tuesday, May 23. The document shows that a Sabo-Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos State last week Thursday granted an application by the police for an extension of remand of Seun Kuti until Tuesday (today), to enable the police to conclude its investigation, and for the advice of the Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecution. POLL The police had told the court that the two days remand extension that was earlier granted was not enough for it to conclude its investigation. Responding to the police’ application, the magistrate said, “I will grant the extension. Matter adjourned to May 23, 2023, for DPP’s advice,” the document exclusively obtained by Punch on Monday revealed.
