The book titled, “Putting The People First”, was authored by Mr. Emmanuel Ado, a veteran journalist and public commentator. He had said, “Any bad thing we find, we will remove so that the next governor does not need to do it again. Watch out till the eleventh hour when we shall quit office. We will continue to sack bad persons and remove bad things.” POLL The governor said this day after his administration revoked the right of occupancy of nine properties belonging to Ahmed Makarfi, former governor of the state, and marked them for demolition.
