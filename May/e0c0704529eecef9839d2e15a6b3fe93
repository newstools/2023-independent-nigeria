inq. Digital Nigeria Limited, a leading Cloud and Digital solutions provider specialis­ing in Edge AI and IoT, Fabric for Cloud Connectivity and Data Center Connectivity, SDN/NFV solutions for Edge Cloud, Secure Access Services Edge, and Elastic Edge in Ni­geria, reaffirms its dedication to promoting gender equality in the Information and Com­munication Technology (ICT) sector. The company calls for support to empower girls, en­abling them to assume their rightful place in the global ICT ecosystem and contribute to technological advancement. This call to action was made during the celebration of the 12th edition of Inter­national Girls in ICT Day, an initiative organized by eBusi­ness Life Magazine and the International Telecommu­nications Union (ITU). The event, held at the prestigious Oriental Hotel, centered around the theme “Digital Skills For Life.” Mr. Valentine Chime, the Managing Director of inq. Digital Nigeria, emphasized the importance of fostering partnerships that encourage the acquisition and develop­ment of digital skills among youths. He stressed the need to bridge the gender divide, which may widen if the girl-child is not adequately drawn into the realm of information and communications technol­ogy (ICT). According to Mr. Chime, “The girl-child must be equipped with digital skills to thrive in the future, as only those who are ICT proficient will succeed. Empowering a girl-child means empowering a nation.” He also underscored the significance of investing in early ICT education, pro­moting the hiring of women in STEM fields, and challeng­ing socio-cultural beliefs that hinder women’s participation in STEM.
