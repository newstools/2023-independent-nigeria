ABUJA  – The Federal Road Safety Corps(­FRSC) has dissociated itself from what it describes as “a baseless and unfounded opinion” current­ly published on different news platforms, linking the Corps with a call for the introduction of Sharia Law to complement existing extant regulations on enforcement of traffic rules and prosecution of offenders. A statement on Saturday by Bisi Kazeem, Assistant Corps Marshal and Corps Public Ed­ucation Officer, FRSC, said the public should note that the entire statement did not, in anyway, re­flect the position of the Federal Road Safety Corps. It would be recalled that the FRSC Sector Commander in Bauchi State, Yusuf Abdullahi, was earlier quoted as saying that the introduction of Sharia Law would curtail bad behaviour by motorists, as most crashes were due to their negative attitudes. The statement pointed out that the Sector Commander who made the statement had been re­called with immediate effect for necessary administrative action. According to the statement, “The Corps Marshal, Dauda Ali Biu, has recalled with immedi­ate effect, the Sector Command­er to the National HQ Abuja, for necessary administrative action because the Sector Commander through the quoted statements has breached the FRSC regula­tions & the Standard Operating Procedures. “Without any reservation, it is key to inform the general public that the FRSC is a Government Agency with statutory responsi­bilities for road safety adminis­tration in Nigeria and sensitive to the country’s multi-religious as well as heterogeneous ethnic composition.”
