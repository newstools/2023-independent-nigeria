 LAGOS – Hon Jude Idimogu, the lawmak­er representing Oshodi/Isolo Constituency 2 at the Lagos State House of Assembly, has said that anybody who loves Nigeria would support Tinubu, as the baton of leadership shifts from President Muhammadu Buhari to the former Lagos State governor. Idimogu in a chat with Daily Independent expressed confi­dence in the ability of Tinubu to fix Nigeria and urged Nige­rians to be patient and always pray for the incoming president who he described as a game changer. “Asiwaju is a game changer, he can be described as a paceset­ter. We have so many lessons to learn from what he has done in Lagos State, which will give us some level of comfort. “The job of fixing Nigeria is daunting and there’s no doubt about that but the good news is that the citizens did the right thing when they supported Asi­waju with their votes on Febru­ary 25. Nigerians will celebrate during Tinubu’s administra­tion because he is the man who has the capacity to do the job. “The next thing that they are going to do is to pray for him. Elections are over and we all have the responsibility to join hands to fix Nigeria. “Tinubu is not president of the All Progressives Congress (APC), he is the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and he will help us fix the country if we support him.” Responding to a question as to what would happen if the court judgment of the presiden­tial election tribunal doesn’t fa­vour Tinubu in the end, POLL Idimogu said, “The truth is that Nigerians have given their mandate to Tinubu and it remains, I am very optimis­tic that the judgment will be in his favour. The man wants to kick off and I am sure that even those who are in court will soon congratulate him. They are Nigerians and I am sure that they love this country, so they will support him when they are done with the court process,” Idimogu said.
