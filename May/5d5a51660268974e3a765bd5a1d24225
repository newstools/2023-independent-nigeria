Governor Obaseki further admonished them to avoid the use of social media for ethnic jingoism, rumor peddling and the promotion of hatred rather their activities online should be targeted at self-improvement as well as for the promotion of unity, peace, and development of the country. Advising them further, the governor said they must be wary of acts that can portray the scheme in a bad light, especially drug abuse and trafficking, cybercrime, and advanced fee fraud.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ On the part of the scheme state’s coordinator, Oladeinde Foluke, she said the three weeks of training received on camp has not only instilled in them the core values of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme but has also impacted positively in them the readiness to embark on developmental projects that will help uplift the nation.
