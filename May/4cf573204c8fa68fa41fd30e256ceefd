Leeds United have officially announced that “The remaining four games of the season will be overseen by experienced head coach Sam Allardyce.” Allardyce is known for being a master at saving teams from relegation, he did so with Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Everton. However, he could not save West Bromwich Albion from going down to the Championship in his last job. Leeds need Allardyce right now but it does mark a remarkable turn of events for a club that had Marcelo Bielsa as their manager last season. Since Bielsa, they have had Jesse Marsch, Michael Skubala and Javi Gracia all have a go in the dugout with limited success.
