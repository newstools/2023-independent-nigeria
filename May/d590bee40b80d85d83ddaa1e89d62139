Operatives of National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have arrested thirty-four suspects during its raid on illicit drug dens in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The agency’s FCT Commander, Kabir Tsakuwa, told newsmen in Abuja that some of the suspects had been charged, while those identified as users were undergoing counselling. He explained that the operation was necessitated by the need to combat drug abuse, especially as Nigeria prepares for handover to a new administration. He further explained that the command initiated ‘Operation Tsaro’ on May 8 to shut down drug centres and apprehend dealers in the FCT. According to him, “Our operatives seized a variety of illicit substances, including cannabis sativa, methamphetamine, tramadol, codeine, Rohypnol, and other psychotropic substances.” Tsakuwa assured of the continuation of the raid with the intention to curb criminal activities in the FCT as a way of reducing the circulation of hard drugs. He explained that some of the drug hotspots raided include Torabora, Dei-dei, Wuse Zone 4, Wuse Zone 3, Banex, Garki Village, Area 1, Gwarinpa (Village, 3rd Avenue), Abattoir in Karu, Gwagwalada, Kabusa, and Kuchigoro IDP Camp.
