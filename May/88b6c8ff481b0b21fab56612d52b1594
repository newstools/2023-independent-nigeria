The Oyo State government has launched maintenance manuals for the Primary Healthcare Centres, PHCs, in Oyo State, urging residents, especially rural dwellers, to access quality and affordable healthcare in each functional facility. The Commissioner for Health, Dr. Bode Ladipo, who made the call in Ibadan said the Oyo State Government has put in huge resources to facilitate the upgrade of PHCs. He said the essence of the step was to make sure each political ward has a viable healthcare center, adding that about 210 of these PHCs were renovated in Governor Makindeâ€™s first tenure, while other PHCs will be completed to make up the remaining 351 PHCs. Dr. Ladipo who said the Oyo State Government is aware of the manpower shift from this clime to more economically buoyant climes, added that the Government has started looking inward to shore up resources that will ensure it meets the needs of practitioners. He reiterated the commitment of the Oyo State Government to maintain all the healthcare facilities in the State, saying the facilities put together, should outlast successive administrations.
