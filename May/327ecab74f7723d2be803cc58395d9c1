The Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC has presented a total of N2.2 trillion Naira budget to the House of Representative Committee on NDDC. The budget covered 2021, 2022 and 2023 respectively. The Chairman of the Committee Hon.

In his response, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the NCDC, Mr Samuel Ogbuku commended the cooperation received from the committee since the new management took over despite meeting lots of distracting situation which he claimed has since been corrected.
