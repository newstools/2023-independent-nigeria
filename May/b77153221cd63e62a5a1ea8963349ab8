ABUJA – The Spokesman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Daniel Bwala, has come under fire over his recent remarks accusing the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of rigging the February 25 poll in favour of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC). Bwala in an Arise TV interview, alleged that INEC had preplanned to award the APC candidate, Bola Tinubu, with the winner of the election. He also stated that the poll was the most contested in recent times in the country, adding that the judiciary should rise to the occasion and correct perceived anomalies in the exercise. But the convener of Northern Conscience for 2023 (NCfor2023), Garus Gololo, faulted Bwala’s position on the election. According to Gololo, “Bwala and others making similar arguments should realize that the case is already in court, and such utterances could amount to contempt”. He warned that the PDP presidential campaign spokesman “must approach these issues with extreme caution, especially as he is a lawyer, to avoid misleading the public”.
