Governments at all levels and media practitioners have been advised to bring to the front burner issues relating to peo­ple living with disabilities and find a way of addressing them. The call was part of a res­olution reached at the end of the one-day training for media practitioners in Nigeria and other stakeholders, organised by the Journalists for Demo­cratic Rights (JODER) with the support of Ford Foundation West Africa Regional Office. The training with the theme; ‘Training and Capaci­ty Building for Effective Cov­erage of Disability issues es­pecially as it affects Children’ was held in Lagos. A communiqué issued at the end of the training and signed by Segun Abifarin, David Anyaele, Joseph Chi­bo and Bukola George, their executives, noted that the rights of People Living With Disabilities (PLWDs) was an important human right issue. The executives declared that democracy and good governance were incomplete without equitable focus on the rights of PLWDs. Participants regretted that national, state and local govern­ments budget conception, plan­ning and implementation take littlecognisanceof PLWDs, espe­cially children with disabilities. “Education policies and the construction of public schools, public buildings in­cluding state and national as­semblies across the country are with little or no consider­ation for PLWD,” they said.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ They noted further that education of children with disabilities was confined to very few, poorly staffed, poorly equipped and outdated special schools; in the public sphere, with low public awareness on issues of inclusive education, inadequate institutional and human capacities required to implement inclusive education.
