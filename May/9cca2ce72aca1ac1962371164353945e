The Yoruba generalissimo stated further that Pa Fasonranti’s life is a testimony of his dedication to the growth and development of humanity. “Baba was a teacher of all teachers. He is a disciplinarian and advocate of restructuring. He did his best in promoting the ideals of fiscal and true federalism as the main fulcrum of the late chief Obafemi Awolowo’s policy direction. “As one of the disciples of the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Baba’s record of honesty, discipline and transparency as a teacher, lecturer and former commissioner stood him out as a man of integrity. “Yoruba is blessed to have him around at this critical time when those qualities have become relatively scarce commodities in our society. “Those of us that are looking up to him are gaining a lot from his wealth of experiences and knowledge and we are happy to celebrate Baba’s life of service to humanity. Iba Adams also urged all the leaders to learn from the leadership qualities of Pa Reuben Fasonranti whose exemplary life remains a reference point in both public and private life.
