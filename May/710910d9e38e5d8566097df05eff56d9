ABUJA – The breakaway group of the Labour Party (LP) led by the former Deputy National Chairman, Apapa Lamidi, has accused Julius Abure, the LP National Chairman, and other officials of the party, of being in bed with the governing All Progressives Congress (APC). The suspended former National Publicity Secretary, Abayomi Arabambi told the media that Abure and other party officials used the opportunity of the opposition party as a money-minting front to enrich themselves. Arabambi’s allegation stemmed from a visit on Wednesday to the National Secretariat of the Labour Party in Abuja by some senators who were reportedly lobbying across political parties for principal offices in the National Assembly. The embattled former national publicity secretary had accused Abure and other party officials of accepting N500 million bribes from the visiting lawmakers, an allegation countered by the National Chairman. Details soon.
