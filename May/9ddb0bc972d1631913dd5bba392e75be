US President Joe Biden has expressed his readiness to work with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu in further strengthening the relation­ship between Nigeria and the United States of Amer­ica. Biden made this pledge in a statement issued by the White House on the oc­casion of the inauguration of Tinubu as Nigeria’s pres­ident on Monday. The statement read: “On behalf of the people of the United States, I send warm wishes to the government and people of Nigeria as they inaugurate a new pres­ident. “My administration has worked to strengthen ties between the United States and Nigeria, and I look forward to continuing this work with President Tinu­bu to support economic growth, advance security, and promote respect for human rights. “The people-to-people connections between our two countries run partic­ularly deep, nurtured by a vibrant Nigerian diaspora in the United States. “As we further deepen our partnership with Nige­ria, I look forward to draw­ing even more on the ideas and energy of this dynam­ic connection between our countries. “As Africa’s largest de­mocracy and economy, Ni­geria’s success is the world’s success. Elected leaders owe it to their people to show that democracy can deliv­er for their needs. And the United States will continue to work closely with Nige­ria, as a friend and partner, to deliver a more peaceful and prosperous future for our world.”
