ABUJA  – The Federal Capital Territo­ry Administration (FCTA) on Thursday outlined a number of issues that will aid in ad­dressing the problems that are preventing the restoration of the Abuja master plan and degrading the environment. FCTA top officials took turns to speak during the 2023 commemoration of the World Earth Day with the theme: “In­vest in our Planet” about the growth and sanity of Abuja, the nation’s capital. The Coordinator of Abuja Metropolitan Management Council (AMMC),Umar Shai­bu, urged the populace to halt practices that harm the envi­ronment. He bemoaned the unend­ing distortion and destruction of the Abuja Master Plan by the residents. Saying, “Illegal felling of trees, building on water channels and road corridors have distorted and destroyed the plan for development of Abuja”. He however, urged the incoming administration to sustain the enforcement ac­tion already commenced by this outgoing administration, otherwise only our Almighty has the knowledge of the end result. In his presentation, the Director FCT Department of Development Control, Tpl Mukhtar Galadima hinted that over 10,000 illegal struc­tures have been demolished in the last eight years, 500 land grabbing structures re­moved with three hundred hectares of land recovered as the administration’s com­mitment to restore sanity in the territory. He said that this was per­tinent to reverse the norms that have been affecting the officials from restoring the master plan and sanity across the city. POLL He called for the review of the development plan of the city, which according to him, a consultant should be engaged to drive the reforms.
