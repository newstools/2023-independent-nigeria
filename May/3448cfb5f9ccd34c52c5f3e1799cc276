Jurgen Klopp’s team were handed a blow to their future aspirations on Wednesday, with the last hopes of signing Jude Bellingham disappearing out of the window. The Borussia Dortmund star looks set to move to Real Madrid now, with Liverpool fans still hoping he’d choose to go to Anfield, despite Klopp saying that wouldn’t be the case. That though left the team needing to find another midfielder to come in this summer, with the problems they’ve had in the centre of the park all season. Some believe that Trent Alexander-Arnold could be the answer, especially with him turning into Zinedine Zidane against Fulham on Wednesday. However, they’re definitely going to need to sign some quality in midfield, if they want to get back to challenging Manchester City for the title. And now it seems that they have found their number one target, with Fabrizio Romano reporting that they have already spoken to Mac Allister. According to the Italian journalist, they have presented their project and financial details to the World Cup winner, and his departure from Brighton is expected early in the transfer window, maybe even this month.
