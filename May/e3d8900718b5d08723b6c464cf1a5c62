For Babajide Sipe, the Group Head Communication at Ecobank, itâ€™s time to reap from his good managerial skills. The astute marketing communications expert was recently garlanded as the Communication Manager of the Year by the Champion Newspapers. For his unique skill and rare mien as a communication expert, Babajide Sipe has been taking the bank to greater heights, opening new doors and ensuring lesser crisis at the bank since he came on board few months ago. His latest award is an attestation to the fact that he is someone who knows how to nip the bud at the right time when it comes to solving problems through marketing communication techniques and innovations. Smart and ever-smiling Babajide Sipe has traversed many corporate organisations in insurance and banking before berthing at Ecobank to bring his wealth of experience into bearing, and this has been showing evidently in the manner he has been handling thorny issues positively with positive results, which the management is now proud of, thanks to Sipe and his team at the Communications department of the Pan Africa Bank. This new garland will surely spur Babajide Sipe to more ground-breaking exploits and create a new improved image for Ecobank.
