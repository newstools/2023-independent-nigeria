Outspan Nigeria Limited, a subsidiary of Olam, has vaccinated local cattle against foot and mouth disease (FMD) that can negatively impact productivity across the dairy value chain. The vaccination exercise, which was fully sponsored by the business and organised in partnership with the Kano Dairy Cooperative, was held recently in Dawakin Kudu LGA, Kano. The latest vaccination exercise is the second phase of wider intervention, targeting 1,000 cattle– having previously targeted the vaccination of 1,500 dairy cattle in 2021. The efforts form part of the business’ robust local dairy value chain backward integration (BIP) investment which aims to raise the level of milk production in the country in support of the federal government’s economic diversification agenda. Praveen Paulsamy, Vice President of ofi Dairy in Nigeria in a statement said, “We are committed to the Federal Government’s economic development agenda. Hence, we’re looking to continue our investment in developing the local dairy value chain to remove the hurdles that have been impeding growth in that area. “Animal health is a significant component of any dairy value chain development focus. Helping the dairy farmers vaccinate their cattle is a valuable investment that has the potential to improve the cattle milk production and reproduction levels in the long run,” he said. Praveen said that the business is aiming to keep scaling the current support for dairy farmers in terms of providing more training for the farmers, aiding milk collection efficiency, expanding the access to cold chain logistics, improving the off-taking arrangement and increasing the availability of quality feed to nourish the cattle. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
