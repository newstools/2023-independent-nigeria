The Federal Government has commenced payment of salary arrears to some University lecturers. A source from the Nnamdi Azikiwe University who spoke to journalists in Abuja on Wednesday said the government was selective in the payment of the varsity lecturers as only medical lecturers were being paid their withheld salaries as of the time. The source told The PUNCH that only lecturers in the departments of Basic Medical Sciences, Basic Clinical Sciences and Medicine across some federal universities are being attended while others are yet to be settled. The lecturers are under the Nigerian Association of Medical and Dental Academics, one of the two splinter groups licensed by the government to reduce the influence of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Naija News understands. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s government had in 2022, implemented a no-work-no-pay rule against lecturers for seven months due to the strike embarked upon by the ASUU.
