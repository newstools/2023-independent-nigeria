Napoli have shown interest  in signing Lille’s Jonathan David as a potential replacement for Victor Osimhen if the Nigerian striker does depart the club this summer. Il Mattino reports that Napoli president Aurelio de Laurentiis is tempted by striking another deal with Lille for a striker if Osimhen does leave and if a potential suitor ends up offering the €160 million that the club currently want. De Laurentiis is keen on signing players from Asia and the Americas and David fits the bill, with the move still very much in the preliminary stages. While De Laurentiis doesn’t want to let the likes of Osimhen and Kim Min-Jae leave this summer, he knows that the temptations from the Premier League could prove to be too much after one point. The report added that apart from David, Atalanta’s Rasmus Højlund and Sassuolo’s Armand Lauriente are also on Napoli’s shortlist.
