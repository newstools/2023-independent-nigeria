MINNA – Barely a week to the end of the current dispensation, Gov­ernor Simon Bako Lalong of Plateau State, while in Niger State over the weekend, said he is capable of handling crim­inals and would end the reign of terror in commu­nities across Plateau before leaving office. Governor Lalong, a re­cipient of the Ibrahim Bad­amasi Babangida University (IBBU), Lapai’s Honorary Doctorate Degree of Admin­istration (Honoris Causa), spoke shortly after the 4th convocation ceremony of the university. Commenting on the series of attacks in communities by gunmen, of which the most recent left about 117 people dead and several others in­jured while over 20, 000 dis­placed, said the criminals had resurfaced, but that the state government would deal with them before he takes his exit from office. “In the past eight years, I have tried to ensure there is peace, unfortunately I am tak­ing my exit and the criminals are beginning to rear their heads again. I am capable of handling them before I take my exit and I will continue to pray for peace in the Plateau state.” On the measures taken so far to end bloodletting, the governor said, “We have nipped insecurity in the bud. Our security agencies are al­ready addressing the recent issue. The IDPs are being taken care of and we have jets flying over the affected communities and local gov­ernment areas”. Meanwhile, Governor Lalong has expressed his ap­preciation to Niger State Gov­ernment for honoring him and others with the doctorate degrees, assuring that they would be good ambassadors of the institution in uphold­ing themselves with dignity, integrity and excellence.
