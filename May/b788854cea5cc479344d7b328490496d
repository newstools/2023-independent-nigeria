A’Ibom Govt Unveils Digitized  Data-Base System For Public Service’ UYO – As one of his parting gifts to the people of Akwa Ibom State, Governor Udom Emmanuel has unveiled a digitalised data base system to upgrade operations of public service In the state. The Public Service digitalisation which consists of the Human Resource Management and Asset Records of the state public service will make the management of over 29,000 workers easy with just a click of buttons on the computer. Governor Emmanuel who unveiled the GO-Live system at the Banquet Hall of the Government House,Uyo on Tuesday said the target is to meet global best practice in the state public service.. Emmanuel said the desire to digitalise the civil service was in compliance with the dictates of the 21st century, adding that it would revolutionise the operations of the civil service and end the duplication of personnel records. In his words “When I came into office, I had the challenges of workers, pensioners coming to do verification. I said not in the 21st century can we be going through all these? Seamlessly, there can be a process that from the day you are applying into the civil service, you can just run through until the day you leave this earth, and that is what we just launched today. “I challenged my people that I would not leave office with what I inherited. The day I leave office, I must hand over to my successor, a full digitised civil service, at least starting from the human resource manager which is a major challenge. “So with what you are seeing here today, if we are advertising for a vacancy, say in the civil service, once you click and apply, the system would automatically assign you a number, and that number would be like your social security number in other developed nations; that is the number you would use until you are out.”
