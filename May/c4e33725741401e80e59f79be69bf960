AWKA – Supporters of Mr Peter Obi, Presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), have said that the ongoing attacks on the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, in a statement that did not even emanate from him saying the attacks come from its enemies, disguised as Obidients. In a statement issued by Diran Onifade of Obi-Datti Media Office, he described the attacks as “yet another campaign of calumny emanating from opposition ranks, this time blaming ‘Obidients’ for recent unjustified social media attacks on the revered General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye”. He further wrote: “We wish to state categorically that supporters of Mr Peter Obi, like their Principal, have great respect for Pastor Adeboye and therefore are not involved in any social media hounding of the revered man of God most especially over a statement he did not make. “It has become a pattern for desperate political operatives to orchestrate a ruse and blame it on Peter Obi’s supporters in furtherance of the opposition’s subterfuge strategy which has failed back to back. “We wish to appeal to fellow Nigerians to ignore the antics of election riggers who believe that demarketing Peter Obi is their sure means of keeping a stolen mandate”. Onifade said that it should be known by now that “issuing personal insults is not Peter Obi’s character and he does not encourage his followers to engage in same”.
