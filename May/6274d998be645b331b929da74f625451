In its avowed determination to ensure that students learn under a conducive atmosphere as well as to forestall the potential hazards inherent in the conduct of teaching and learning in crowded classes, the Prof. Ibiyemi Olatunji-Bello-led management of Lagos State University (LASU) has immediately adopted the hybrid lecture system for all general courses in the university. The innovative VC also directed the adoption of the same method for departmental classes with a large number of students. The decision is said to have been reached after a meeting that the Vice Chancellor held with members of the university management and deans of faculties on Monday, 15th May 2023. During the meeting, the Vice Chancellor received a briefing from the Deans concerning the need for bigger lecture rooms to accommodate courses with large numbers of learners and noted that the challenge of ample lecture space is not limited to Lagos State University in the face of a growing number of admitted students and mooted the idea of hybrid classes which was applauded by the Deans. She gave an assurance that the facilities needed to prosecute the decision would be expeditiously provided. The Vice-Chancellor, thereafter, led members of the University Management on an unscheduled visit to some lecture halls where she met with and addressed eager students on the development. The hybrid lecture system would see some learners physically attend classes while others would be able to join live from their various destinations around the campus, using a designated online platform.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Recall that the hybrid method of teaching is already being used for GNS courses at the university.
