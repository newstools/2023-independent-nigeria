For all of our stakeholders, this operation heralds promising prospects, ” Diagou said. POLL Diaguo said the operation met two objectives to increase the group’s market share in countries that were important for the development of NSIA and to strengthen compliance with the requirements of the regulator of the CIMA zone.
