….Urges APC, Tinubu To Retain Present Leadership Of Senate The leadership of All Progressives Congress (APC) and the President-elect, Bola Tinubu have been called to adopt the same principle of continuity enjoyed by Senator David Mark during the 6th and 7th Senates. The Nigeria National Integrity Group (NNIG), which made this call on Wednesday, said that retaining Ahmad Lawan as the Senate President in the 10th Senate would help to guide against any form of acrimony in the ruling party that will affect the administration of the President-elect. The call became imperative following the uproar being generated by the zoning of the principal offices of the National Assembly. Addressing a press conference in Abuja, the spokesperson of the group, Joseph Ode said bearing in mind the astute and altruistic style of the current leadership of the Nigerian Senate, “we hereby submit unequivocally that the current Senate Leadership should be adopted across party lines to be reelected into office in the overall national interest.” The group said the very serious issue of the Leadership of the National Assembly should not be subjected to the whims and caprices of self-styled party bigwigs since these demanding positions require the right calibre of leaders and statesmen to ensure and enhance the delivery of the dividends of democracy to Nigeria’s teeming long-suffering masses. He therefore said the retention of Senator Ahmed Lawan’s leadership of the National Assembly will “no doubt, foster sustainability, stability and continuity in piloting the affairs of the legislative branch, a critical and vital component of the tripod in the three arms of government. POLL “There is no denying the fact that the current leadership of the National Assembly under Distinguished Senator Ahmed Lawan has ensured the unprecedented harmonious working relationship between the Executive and Legislative arms of the Federal Government. “This is a manifest and a most welcome departure from the unduly fractious and intransigent brinkmanship exhibited by several erstwhile helmsmen at the federal legislature, the worst-case scenario being the recalcitrant and anti-diluvian leadership of the 8th National Assembly.” The group explained that even though the harbingers and beneficiaries of crises in the National Assembly have maliciously and viciously dubbed the 9th Assembly a rubber stamp, ostensibly because they were denied the spoils of the counterproductive executive-legislative wars of attrition, it is however well known that, the executive and legislative amity fostered by the deft handling of the current National Assembly leadership has without a shadow of a doubt, ensured the prompt and positive consideration of the numerous Bills and requests from the executive branch. He said: “The unassuming and highly accommodating leadership of the current leadership of the Senate has effectively prompted the Executive to grant their numerous requests and passage of hundreds of Bills. “With the fortuitous election of a responsive and responsible President in person of the Jagaban, His Excellency Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Nigeria will be best served by the CONTINUATION of the pragmatic and patriotic style of the current Senate under the Leadership of Distinguished Senator Ahmed Lawan, to ensure the rekindling of the renewed hope, a cornerstone of the manifesto of the President-Elect. “Nigerians may recall how the PDP adopted the same principle of Continuity in Leadership with Senator David Mark Presiding over the 6th and 7th Senates. Though the purveyors of parochial ethnoreligious sentiments are bound to raise the red flags that the current Senate President hails from the same geopolitical zone as the vice president-elect, they should however be reminded that as recently as 2015, the Vice President, Senate President and Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives were all of the same ethnic stock and the heavens did not fall.”
