ABUJA – The leadership of the Labour Party (LP), has expressed displeasure at the rancour ranging among groups in the party. At a press conference on Wednesday in Abuja, the opposition party through its Security, Peace and Conflict Resolution Committee (LP-SPCRC) headed by retired Assistant Inspector General (AIG) Charles Ugomuoh, vowed “not to standby and allow the party to disintegrate”. A statement signed by the duo of Ugomoh and the Committee’s Secretary, Diyoke Kenneth, called on aggrieved members and groups to “sheath their swords and explore the internal conflict resolution mechanism of the party”, as provided by the Committee. While noting that the Labour Party “is now the fastest growing party in Africa”, the Committee also warned members against actions that are inimical to LP interests. On its activities in recent time, the statement stressed, “we are happy with its performance and achievements in the last general elections, especially our presidential candidate, Mr Peter Gregory Obi”. This is even as it called on aggrieved persons and groups to “appear before it and ventilate their grievances in line with the party’s internal mechanism of conflicts resolution.” Recall that the Labour Party has been enmeshed in a leadership scuffle with members of its National Working Committee (NWC) at dogger-drawn against one another. A situation that led to the suspension of the former Deputy National Chairman, Lamidi Apapa, the expulsion of the former National Publicity Secretary, Abayomi Arabambi, and other breakaway members, amid a lingering suit on the legitimacy of Julius Abure, as National Chairman of the LP. POLL The LP-SPCRC which was inaugurated in 2022 is meant to among others, develop a security framework for rallies, campaigns, and other party activities; advise on security situations during campaigns in towns/state capitals, and to interface with the security agencies on behalf of the party.
