Governor Hope Uzodimma is never part of any overt or covert gang up to scuttle the All Progressives Congress choice for the Senate Presi­dent. The Imo State Govern­ment which debunked the al­legation Wednesday said that the Governor could not have been associated with such a plan being a loyal Party man to the core. The government said the media reports that tried to link Governor Uzodimma to the mischievous plan of any group to support a Sen­ate President other than the one chosen by the APC was unfounded. In a statement issued in Owerri, the State Com­missioner for Information and Strategy, Hon Declan Emelumba explained that “at no time did Uzodim­ma contemplate working against the choice of APC and the President-elect, Al­haji Bola Ahmed Tinubu for the leadership of the 10th Senate.” “As a loyal party man, the governor will stand firmly behind the choice of any per­son or persons chosen by the APC and the President-elect to lead the 10th Senate, and will,, in fact, work assiduous­ly for their emergence.” Emelumba said “the gov­ernor as a loyal Party man would never work against the choices of the Party without supporting another candi­date,” adding “Since Uzodim­ma joined politics over forty (40) years ago, his reputation and integrity as a loyal party man has remained unassail­able.” The Commissioner de­scribed the author of the story as a mischief-maker seeking to destroy the hard-earned reputation of the governor. “Those who know my governor can attest to the fact that he is principled and disciplined. He is also bold and courageous. He doesn’t speak from both sides of the mouth. He leaves you in no doubt where he stands. And for the issue at hand, he sup­ports the position of APC all the way,” he emphasised.
