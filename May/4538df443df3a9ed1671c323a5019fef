KATSINA – The Katsina State Pilgrims Wel­fare Board has flagged off the conduct of 2023 Hajj Pilgrims education and enlightenment classes designed for the benefit of intending pilgrims from the state. The event, the first phase of the continued version of the new model of pilgrims enlightenment programme tagged “THREE IN ONE” introduced by the board last year, was held at the pilgrims board’s headquarters in Katsina on Saturday. Governor Aminu Bello Ma­sari, while declaring the sensiti­sation workshop open, charged the intending pilgrims to take advantage of the programme to enhance their knowledge of Hajj rites and the new opera­tional guidelines and policies introduced by Saudi Arabia and NAHCON. “Your active participation will undoubtedly enhance your Islamic knowledge on Hajj rites and the opportunity to gain prop­er guidance on your trip to the Holy land for pilgrimage.” Masari, represented by Isa La­wal Doro, the state Commission­er for Religious Affairs, said the state government had provided all needed support to the board to effectively mobilise the Ulamas, Resource Persons and other stakeholders to achieve desired objectives. He, therefore, called on the intending pilgrims to recipro­cate the gesture by attending the classes to enhance their knowl­edge of the exercise. Alhaji Suleiman Nuhu Kuki, the Executive Director of the board, in his remarks, said, at­tendance by intending pilgrims is mandatory, each must record 75 percent attendance to qualify for visa and eventual undertak­ing of the trip.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
