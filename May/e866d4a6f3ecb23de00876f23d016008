Sudan has extended the closure of Sudanese airspace until May 23 amid continued fighting between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement that “humanitarian aid and evacuation flights” would be exempted as long as they obtain a permit from relevant authorities. Sudanese airspace was closed to regular traffic after a military conflict erupted between the country’s army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in mid-April. Video clips circulating online showed the damage to the Khartoum Airport due to the heavy fighting. The conflict that broke out a month ago has killed hundreds of people, sent more than 200,000 into neighbouring states, displaced another 700,000 inside the country. The two sides have battled through previous truces and have shown no sign of being willing to compromise. Representatives of both generals have been in the Saudi city of Jeddah for a week, for talks intended “to protect Sudan from any escalation that will lead to a humanitarian catastrophe.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Representatives of the warring parties will resume talks on Sunday on how to implement plans to deliver humanitarian aid and remove troops from civilian areas.
