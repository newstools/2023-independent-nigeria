Fans of Nigerian musician, Olawale Ashimi, popularly known as Brymo, have been left distraught as one of his acclaimed albums, ‘Yellow’ has been pulled off major streaming platforms. Last Wednesday, the singer announced that the 15-track album is being taken off streaming platforms and may not be returned. “‘Yellow’ is going down on streaming platforms, and I am afraid I may not be able to reinstall it,” he tweeted to his fans. He later announced that efforts are on the way to re-upload and reinstate ‘Yellow’ for listenership. Following repeated queries from his fans, the soni artiste, as he refers to himself, revealed that the situation may likely be caused by dissatisfaction by one of the featured artistes on the album. He wrote; “About Yellow ??…had something to do with Lndsey’s ‘Abu Ya’, and her discontent over how I handled and published her valuable contribution towards the project. Though events took place at the behest of my former management, yet I’m still talking with the aggregator to fix it. “Yellow is the seventh studio album by Brymo, released independently on April 1, 2020. It serves as the follow-up to his live album, ‘Live! at Terra Kulture Arena’ released in 2019. Described by Brymo as an album about “love and survival”, ‘Yellow’ is an alternative pop and electronic record that incorporates elements of sentimental ballad, trap, sophisti-pop, shoegaze, rock, synth-pop and folk. Abu Ya is the 15th song on the ‘Yellow’ album. The track has Nigerian new soul singer, Lindsey Abudei and Brymo as songwriters. Abudei is the only artist featured on the album which was nominated for Best Alternative Album and Album of the Year at The Headies 2020.
