LAGOS – The Labour And Civil Society Front (LCSF), an emergent citizens’ movement, has warned that it will have no other option than to mobilise a nationwide citizens’ mass action to save Nigeria’s democracy if Nigeria’s judiciary fails to determine the rightful winner of the 2023 presidential elections by May 29. The group was convened by 70 Prominent Leaders of Labour and Civil Society Movements with the full backing of the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, Trade Union Congress (TUC), National Consultative Front (NCFront) and notable Youth coalitions. The group in a Statement on Tuesday in Abuja said that it has concluded plans to mobilise all its affiliates and allies worldwide to commence a full-blown citizens’ mass action from May 29 if the Presidential Elections Tribunal fails to do justice in the ongoing presidential petition cases Speaking through its National Youth Coordinator, Dr Mo Paul, the coalition said it has already commenced mobilisation of its affiliates and allied social forces in preparation for the May 29 Citizens’ Intervention but hopes the judiciary will rise to avert the planned Mass Action. The Labour-Civil Society Front, LCSF launched last month at the Labour House, Abuja, also chided the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for shoddy conduct of the 2023 general elections and asked the electoral body to apologise to Nigerians for breaching the electoral act and the constitution of Nigeria. The movement accused INEC of foisting sham elections on the country, especially with its failure to fulfil the requirement of the law for electronic transmission of election results as provided by the electoral act 2022. “With what the country witnessed during the 2023 general elections, we think there’s no hope for Nigerians, especially the Youths of our country and that is why we are insisting that the errors and infractions committed during the elections must be corrected by the judiciary before May 29 to save the country from being shut down via an inevitable citizens’ intervention to reset Nigeria,” the group stated.
