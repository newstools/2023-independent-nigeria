OWERRI – Desirous to strengthen govern­ment’s measures against envi­ronmental hazards in the state, the Imo State Ministry of Sanita­tion and Hygiene has assembled an affiliate team of Environmen­tal Health Field Assistants to ease its operations. The team, which will operate with aprons bearing “3R” Ministry of Sanitation and Hygiene, Filed Assistants, is expected to embark on a sustainable public enlighten­ment campaign against all forms of impediments to good health. The Commissioner in charge of the Ministry, Dr. Elias Martins Emedom, while receiving mem­bers of the team in his office, charged them to work in syner­gy with the staff of his Ministry saddled with similar responsibili­ties and also to operate within the confines of the enabling law that established them. Emedom, a medical expert, noted that sanitation and hy­giene are indispensable factors for healthy living and meaningful business ventures in any society, but regretted that avoidable envi­ronmental pollution and degra­dation had more often than not become stumbling blocks to man. He said: “The 3R Mantra of Governor Hope Uzodinma is people friendly and therefore, you must be friendly with the public, shun thuggery and all manner of violence in the performance of your duties”. The commissioner also stressed the need for them to be sincere and transparent in rev­enue collection and to pay the same to the government’s Trea­sury Single Account (TSA) as at and when due.
