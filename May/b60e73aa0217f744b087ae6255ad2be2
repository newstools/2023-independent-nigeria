As President Bola Ahmed Tinubu took the mantle of leadership in Nigeria on Monday, Pastor Adewale Giwa of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry has expressed disappointment over the conduct of some ministers of God over the last presidential election. According to a statement released and amde available to journalists in Akure on Monday, the senior pastor declared that God didn’t care about politics, but cared about the people who obeyed Him. Prior to Tinubu’s nauguration ceremony, some religious leaders within the Christian Community had predicted that the former Lagos State Governor would not be sworn in, which Giwa described as prophesies made from the flesh. He said: “They didn’t hear from God, because He doesn’t care about politics. We only surrendered ourselves to the flesh instead of the Holy Spirit. “We allowed our emotions to control us instead of keeping our hope in Jesus alive. We often display fear, anger and worry. “Rather than love, we fight. Rather than strive for unity, we throw stones at the other side. Instead of resting in the peace God gives us, we worry about what we cannot control. We have placed our hope in politics and our actions show it. “That’s not the way it should be. I think there are a few things we need to remind ourselves of about the election and politics. “When we put our hope in something other than Christ, we will eventually be let down. Our role in the society is to advise, criticise if necessary and speak the truth to power.” POLL Commenting expectations from the newly sworn in President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the cleric said Tinubu would always be remembered for good if he deemef it necessary to transform Nigeria beyond the expectations of the people. “He doesn’t need to be reminded of what to do; he lives in Nigeria and knows what to do to make the citizens happy. He needs to make electricity stable for foreign investors and Nigerians, tackles security challenges and boosts the nation’s economy.”
