The Council Chairperson Idemili-South Local Government Area of Anambra state, Hon. Amaka Obi has announced the establishment of free healthcare sustainable plan for the elderly in the council area. Announcing it while presenting her address at the council headquarters Ojoto during the commencement of Ward-based Medical Outreach, she said the elderly required comprehensive medical care and that she would ensure that they got medical attention they deserved because of their age in all the 9 primary healthcare centres of the 7 communities in the area. Obi who said that healthcare provision was top on the agenda of the Soludo administration, maintained that henceforth Idemili-South will prioritize healthcare as well as ensure a universal health coverage for all in Idemili-South. Meanwhile over 500 elderly men, women and children found their way to the Ojoto council headquarters for the commencement of the Ward-based Free Medical Mission where they all got free diagnosis and testing for blood sugar, blood pressure, HIV testing, eye checks and a host of others together with free medications. The Commissioner for Health Dr. Ben Afam Obidike who attended the event in the company of other senior officers in the health sector, described the free medical mission as laudable, saying that the exercise would help to save more lives. Obidike noted that the present administration was working assiduously to ensure that all PHCs met the minimum requisite standards for the provision of comprehensive healthcare at the grassroots level.
