Russian strikes killed one person and wounded three others in the Ukrainian region of Kherson, a regional official said Monday. Moscow also launched a hail of missiles across Ukraine early on Monday, with Kyiv reporting it had shot down most of the projectiles. “Over the past day, the enemy carried out 39 shellings, firing 163 shells from heavy artillery, Grads, UAVs, and aviation. The enemy shelled the city of Kherson eight times,” said Oleksandr Prokudin, of the military administration for Kherson, in Ukraine’s south. “As a result of Russian aggression, one person died and three others, including a child, were injured.” Russia still controls part of the Kherson region, having withdrawn from the eponymous regional capital last November.

The Ukrainian Air Force said on Telegram that 18 missiles were launched from planes, with 15 of them destroyed. Shelling wounded 25 people in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast and damaged dozens of buildings in the city of Pavlohrad, according to the regional administration.

The latest Russian attacks came as Kyiv prepares for a long-awaited counteroffensive, having vowed to expel Russian forces from territory they seized in the east and south following their 2022 invasion. On Sunday a predawn Ukrainian strike on a Russian border village killed four people and wounded two others, officials there said.
