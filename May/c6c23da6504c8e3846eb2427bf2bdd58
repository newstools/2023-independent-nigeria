ABUJA – The New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) on Friday insisted that Mubarak Musa remains its governorship candidate for Kogi State with Tanimu Idris as his running mate. The party also dissociated itself from those allegedly claiming to be its governorship candidate in the State, “and warned the impostor to desist from his campaign of calumny forthwith or face the full weight of the law as there is no faction in our great party”. A statement by the party’s national publicity secretary, Agbo Major, said that “Mubarak Saliu Musa is the authentic New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) governorship candidate for Kogi State with Tanimu Idris as running mate. “Dr Musa won the party’s governorship primary election in Lokoja, Kogi State which was duly monitored by the officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and was issued the NNPP certificate of return. “The national leadership of the party, Kogi State Chapter and stakeholders in the quest for a better Kogi State are all in support of Dr Musa’s candidature and have been campaigning vigorously for him and his running mate, Tanimu Idris to win the forthcoming gubernatorial election in the State as the party did in Kano State recently. “A man of enormous intellectual capacity, honour and integrity, Dr Mubarak Saliu Musa is the most credible and competent candidate for governor of Kogi State. “NNPP dissociates itself from any other person claiming to be the party’s governorship candidate in the State and warns the impostor to desist from his campaign of calumny forthwith or face the full weight of the law as there is no faction in our great party. “As a grassroots political party, NNPP is strongly determined to win the Kogi State governorship poll and will not tolerate any distraction in the patriotic zeal to transform the state to a modern industrial one and deliver dividends of democracy to the long-suffering and marginalized people. POLL “NNPP, therefore, urges the good people of Kogi to vigorously support, campaign and elect Dr Mubarak as the next governor of Kogi state come November 2023”.
