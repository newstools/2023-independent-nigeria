There was a mild panic during the coronation of King Charles III and his wife, Queen Camilla, as one of the flagbearers reportedly slumped at Westminster Abbey, London, the venue of the event on Saturday. Pictures show the flagbearer dressed in red regalia with pairs of black trousers and black shoes being rescued by his colleagues. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the coronation of King Charles marked the first in Britain since 1953 (about 70 years ago). Meanwhile, his 75-year-old wife, Camilla, was crowned by Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, as the Queen moments after Charlesâ€™ coronation as sovereign head of the United Kingdom and 14 other Commonwealth realms.
