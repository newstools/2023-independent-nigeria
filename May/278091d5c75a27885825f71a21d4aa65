Sequelled to the investigation over the assault of police by Seun Kuti, son of Afrobeat maestro, Fela Kuti, the Police have said they discovered suspicious items while searching his residence. The Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, made this known while reacting to criticism on social media. Seun Osewa, Nairaland founder, had accused the police of harassing Kuti’s family by ransacking their home and seizing his wife’s phone. “The harassment of Seun Kuti’s family by ransacking their home & seizing his wife’s phone is wrong.” “You’re making people who were sympathetic to the police because Seun Kuti’s behaviour was despicable to remember why they hated the police before. This is bad PR for the police,” Osewa tweeted. In response, Hundeyin said, “In the course of our investigation, we stumbled on certain suspicious things that needed to be proven/disproved beyond a reasonable doubt. “We, therefore, applied for and duly got a search warrant from the court which we have executed. Investigation continues. “No law restricts the police to investigate only the initial crime. World over, Police Departments stumble on other crimes while investigating an initial crime. We are duty bound to investigate them in line with our mandate of detecting and investigating crimes.”
