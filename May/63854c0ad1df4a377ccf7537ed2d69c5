LAGOS – Air Peace has commenced the airlift of Nigerian pilgrims for the 2023 Hajj. A statement by Mr. Stanley Olisa, the Spokesman of the airline said that the first batch of pilgrims was airlifted on Fri­day with one of its Boeing 777 aircraft. Air Peace is one of the air­lines approved by the Federal Government for the airlift and had signed an agreement with the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), earlier this month. At the signing ceremony with NAHCON, Mr. Allen Onyema, the Chairman of Air Peace, said the airline cared for the Nigeri­an pilgrims and was carrying out the operation for national pride. Hajj is an annual Islamic pil­grimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the holy city for Muslims. Every adult Muslim is expect­ed to embark on this religious jour­ney at least once in their lifetime.
