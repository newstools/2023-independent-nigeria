No fewer than six teachers in the service of the Oyo State Government have been demoted, over their involvement in examination malpractice. The state government announced the demotion of the affected teachers via a letter obtained by Daily Independent on Sunday. TESCOM made the disclosure via a letter signed by Orowale M. I. on behalf of the commission’s chairman, addressed to the Tutor-General in the Saki zone of the state. According to the letter, the teachers were demoted over their involvement in examination malpractice during the 2022 Senior School Certificate Examination, conducted by the West African Examinations Council (WAEC). Those demoted included Ogunkunle Musibau O., from Grade 14 to 13, and Popoola Akeem Abiola, from Grade 8 to 7, both from Owo Community Grammar School, Owo. Others demoted are Mustapha Bolanle Nureni, from Grade 15 to 14, Ahmed Adamu Ademola, from Grade 10 to 9, Titilola Ajeleye John, from Grade 10 to 9, and Adegbola Abraham Titilope, from Grade 8 to 7. The four teachers are from Progressive Secondary Grammar School in Tede. The Oyo State Primary School Teaching Service Commission (TESCOM) said that the affected teachers have been demoted. POLL The commission said the decision to demote the affected teachers was a result of the findings of the panel set up to investigate them. It added that the panel found the affected teachers guilty. The letter partly reads: “I am directed to refer to the above subject and inform you that, in line with the recommendations of the panel of inquiry set up to investigate the allegations of examination malpractice levelled against some secondary schools in the state by WAEC during the 2022 Senior School Certificate Examination, the Commission has agreed that the following classroom teachers in your zone be downgraded by a grade level.”
