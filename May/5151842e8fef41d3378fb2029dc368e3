Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has said his “legacy is exceptional” as he prepares for Wednesday’s Champions League semi-final second leg against Real Madrid. Treble-chasing City, who have never been European champions, drew 1-1 at the Bernabeu in last Tuesday’s first leg. Guardiola has won two Champions Leagues as a manager, with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011. “I have been here many times,” he said to BBC. “My legacy is exceptional already. I have told the players to enjoy the moment – we are incredibly lucky to be here. “It’s in our hands, it depends on us, we don’t have to do something exceptional – just win one game to reach the final. “I have an incredible feeling about them. Whatever happens – thank you so much to them for bringing me and the City fans here again.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
