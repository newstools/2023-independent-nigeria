The Executive Chairman of Ughelli South Local Government Council, Olorogun Dr. Richard Kofi, has congratulated the Governor-elect of Delta State, Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori on his victory at the Court of Appeal, Abuja on Friday. The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja, on Friday 5th May 2023, dismissed a pre-election appeal filed by Chief Ikie Aghwarianovwe, seeking the disqualification of Delta State Governor-elect, Rt Hon Sheriff Oborevwori. Chief Ikie had filed a suit sometime in October 2022, alleging that Rt. Hon. Oborevwori submitted false documents to INEC to aid his qualification for the 2019 House of Assembly election in Delta State. Chief Ikie further claimed that as a result of the alleged forged documents, Rt. Hon. Oborevwori was not qualified to contest the Delta State 2023 gubernatorial election. Kofi in a statement, congratulated, leaders and supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party on the victory. He noted that the judgement further affirmed Rt. Hon. Oborevwori was eminently qualified to be governor of Delta State and further validated his victory in the exercise. “This is indeed a victory for democracy, the PDP and the good people of Delta State who freely gave Oborevwori the mandate to govern them for the next four years. This will also serve as a boost for the Governor-elect who will be sworn in on May 29 to deliver dividends of democracy to his people,” Kofi added.
