MINNA – The in-coming Governor of Niger State, Umar Mohammed Bago, has assured Christians in the state that the administration would carry everyone along, adding that nobody would be discriminated against on the grounds of religious, tribal or regional linings. Bago, who was, however, quick to add that the beginning of the administration may be rough for reasons he did not ex­plain, encouraged Christians in the state to continue to pray for the success of the adminis­tration. Speaking at the pre-inaugu­ral church service, which took place at the St. Michael’s Cathe­dral Church, Minna on Sunday, Bago encouraged Christians to ignore religious fanatics who use religion to cover up their administrative weaknesses. The Chancellor of the An­glican Communion, Anglican Diocese of Minna, Abraham Yisa Ndaa’na, had earlier in a goodwill message, told the in­coming Governor to, ‘lead with the fear of God so that you will have followers’. Yisa, who reminded Bago that the people are indeed an­gry and there is bitterness in the land, said: “People are hungry and they are not happy the way things are going. They prayed that the first four years of the in-coming dispensation will unite and not divide Nigerlites the more.” While pleading with Bago not to toe the path of religious bias in the composition of his cabinet, Yisa reminded him that Christians in the state have been seriously marginalised and, therefore, want the trend to change in the spirit of, equity, fairness and justice for all. Yisa also reminded the in-coming government that Christians have not benefitted as their Moslem counterparts from state government spon­sorship of pilgrimages in the recent past and, therefore, want the Bago-led administration to close ranks and ensure equity for all.
