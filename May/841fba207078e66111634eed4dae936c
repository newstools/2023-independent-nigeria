The insurance risk premium rates currently applicable in the country have been described as too low and unsustainable for the development of the insurance industry. Decrying the underpricing of insurance premiums, group managing director of Cornerstone Insurance Plc, Mr. Ganiyu Musa, said underwriters have deviated from the basics of the profession in the sense that all have collectively driven insurance rates to levels that are not sustainable. This is as the top-line of the underwriting firm rose to about N24 billion in its 2022 financial year, growing by about N4 billion, compared to the N20 billion it posted in the 2021 financial year. Speaking at the Cornerstone Insurance Plc 2023 Brokers Events held separately in Abuja and Lagos, Mr Musa, said as a result of premium underpricing, profitability across the insurance industry is below par and not comparable to what is seen in other arms of the financial services sector He urged underwriters to work together to ensure that premium rates in the industry are improved. According to him, though the banking sector is faced with same regulatory constraints on pricing, “For instance if the CBN says you cannot lend for more than 21 per cent, or that you cannot pay less than two per cent interest on current account, for the banks, that maximum lending rate is what applies to the majority of their customers. If anything, in addition to the specified lending rate they also charge documentation fees, legal fees, such that at the end the customer is borrowing above the specified rate.” For us as insurance operators, faced with a similar regulation that says, for instance, motor premium should not be more than 10 per cent, while the banks will take that rate as the minimum that they charge, insurance takes that as the maximum and then drives it down
