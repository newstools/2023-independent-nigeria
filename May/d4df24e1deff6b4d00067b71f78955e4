ABUJA – Dr. Chidia Maduekwe, a Chieftain of the All Progressives Party (APC) and the Managing Director/CEO of the Nigerian Film Corporation (NFC), has congratulated President Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his successful inauguration as Nigeria’s 16th president. In a congratulatory message he sent on Tuesday, Maduekwe stated that Tinubu’s inauguration as the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Nigerian Armed Forces had rekindled optimism for a united, secure and prosperous Nigeria. The NFC helmsman therefore urged stakeholders in the creative industry, especially filmmakers, to support the new president as he rolls out programmes and policies towards ensuring a strong economy, adding that “Nigeria is in capable hands as he is confident that this administration will drive sustainable economic growth and development across all sectors.” He said further: “On behalf of myself and the Nigerian Film Corporation, I heartily congratulate His Excellency Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his successful inauguration as the President, Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “This is a historic occasion in our democratic journey and it surely marks the beginning of a new chapter for our dear nation. “The NFC, which by its mandate is committed to the development of a viable and sustainable film industry and cinema culture in Nigeria, is set to break new grounds under this administration. “I therefore call on all stakeholders in the industry to ensure that the narratives moving forward should be geared towards building a strong and united nation by deliberately promoting those things that bind us as a people with common destiny. “There is no doubt that after agriculture, the audiovisual sector in Nigeria is currently the largest employer of labour, according to NBS statistical analysis,” he said.
