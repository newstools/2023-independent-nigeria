Barcelona president Joan Laporta has confirmed the club want forward Ansu Fati to stay at the Camp Nou amid continued speculation about the 20-year-old’s future. Laporta told TV3 that Barcelona are counting on having Fati in the first-team squad next season but added it will be up to coach Xavi to decide how regularly he plays, as reported by Mundo Deportivo. “He is a man we count on and it is the technical direction that will have to decide what happens with Ansu next season,” he explained. “He’s a Barça player, we love him and he’s a high-quality player and an integrated person, I know he wants to succeed at Barça, we’ll see how it goes.” Fati has struggled for starts for Barcelona in the current campaign, making 32 appearances in La Liga, but being named in the starting XI just 11 times. The youngster’s father has been critical of Xavi’s treatment of his son this season and has advised him to leave Barcelona in an interview with Cope, as reported by Eurosport. Barcelona are reportedly willing to listen to offers of just 40 million euros for Fati, according to Javier Miguel at Diario AS. Yet Fati made it clear earlier in April, after making his 100th appearance for the club, that he wants to stay at Barcelona.
