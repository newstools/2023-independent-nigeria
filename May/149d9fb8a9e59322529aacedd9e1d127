ABUJA – The Lawmaker representing Otukpo/Ohimini Federal constituency on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Hon. Blessings Onuh has urged politicians to stop the culture of filing frivolous petitions that could distract public office holders from delivering the dividends of democracy to the people. She gave the charge at a world press conference in Abuja, where she hinted that elections were over and it is time for political stakeholders to work together irrespective of political leanings. Onuh, while acknowledging that election petitions were an essential part of our democratic process, however warned that the culture of filing frivolous petitions against political opponents was a distraction. The Federal Lawmaker was reacting to the recent withdrawal of the suit instituted by Hon Alex Enokela Ogbe, against her victory in the February 25th National Assembly election. It would be recalled that Ogbe had on Friday, May 19th 2023, announced his decision to withdraw the case instituted against Hon. Lady Blessing Onuh, the APC and INEC in the 2023 election petition tribunal.
