BENIN  – Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has dedicated the award for good governance be­stowed on him by BusinessDay Newspapers to public servants in the State. The governor, in his re­marks after receiving the Award as Most Improved State in Youth and Women Develop­ment 2021, at Abuja Continen­tal Hotel, said public servants who have served with him since 2016 he became governor were even more deserving of the honour. “I thank you for this award. It is good to be reminded that the reward for hard work is more work. For us in Edo State, this is not an award for Gover­nor Godwin Obaseki. “It is an award for the very hard-working public servants in Edo State who have jour­neyed with me since I got into office in November 2016.” On his travail in office, the governor said, “For the country, you know the story of Edo. It is not that we are fighters, but we have to fight to survive and when you look back six and a half years, I don’t know how we could have done it without bril­liant, hardworking, resilient young men and women who have worked with me.” Noting that the state has made tremendous progress in reforming public education, he said: “I am very proud of what we have achieved. Without be­ing immodest, we have reset education in Edo such that the next generation of children will be globally competitive.”
