ABUJA  – The Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite has hinted that the creation of a gemstone market will ensure the diversification of the national economic base of Nigeria. The Minister gave this hint at the commissioning of the Ultra­modern International Gemstone Market Ojoo, Akinyele Local Government Area Ibadan, Oyo State on Thursday 4th May, 2023. The Minister in a statement made available to journalists in Abuja by Funmi Imuetin­yan, Head of Press Department pointed out that the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development had designed six strategic ASM Cluster Projects in the six geopo­litical zones as a means to har­ness the potential of the over three (3) million Artisanal and Small Scale Mining operators in the country, and the creation of International Gemstone Market in Ibadan for the Southwest Zone is one of such projects. He further revealed that the Commissioning of the project is an opportunity to highlight the efforts of the administration of His Excellency, President Mu­hammadu Buhari to open some of the potentials available in the Mining Sector to serve as an al­ternative revenue source. According to the Minister “The landmark projects are to create an enabling environment to support the mining industry through the formalisation of the ASM sub-sector as a major driver of the key growth parameters to engender the development of the mining sector since over 90% of the Mining activities in the coun­try could safely be said to be ASM driven.” He further noted that some of the notable envisaged outcomes from the International Gemstone Market include but are not limit­ed to the creation of over 20,000 jobs along the gemstone mining value chain in the South-West­ern Zone cluster. He added that the newly com­missioned facility houses over 30 stalls, a banking hall, MMSD office, stable power supply to en­able seamless transactions and value addition and lapidary and gemological equipment are pro­vided for training on gemstone faceting and cutting.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Also speaking during the Commissioning, Governor Seyi Makinde, represented by the State Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources, Temilo­la Seun Ashamu remarked that solid mineral is a sector where value can be derived from the ex­isting comparative advantages to grow the economy and improve the GDP of Nigeria.
