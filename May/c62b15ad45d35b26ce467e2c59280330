LAGOS – The Human and Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA Re­source Centre) has lauded the na­tional executives of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) for their decisive disciplinary action against the embattled former Accountant General of the Federation, Jo­nah Ogunniyi, on professional grounds. HEDA, in a statement signed by its Chairman, Olanrewaju Suraju, the anti-corruption group expressed the appreci­ation for ICAN’s fulfilment of commitment to inform the or­ganisation of the outcome of a disciplinary proceeding against Jonah Otunla. The group had previously filed a complaint against Otunla, accusing him of embezzlement and stealing approximately N6.3 billion. Suraju stated: “We received the judgment with excitement and assurance that accountabil­ity is about to take firm root in our professional associations. We also commend the President of the Institute and his Council members on this act. “We, as an organization, be­lieve that the disciplinary action and its outcome will further de­ter corrupt practices among members of this noble profes­sion. Thank you once again as you are always assured of our support and commitment to pro­fessional integrity, enforcement of ethics, and the fight against corruption and misappropria­tion of public funds in the coun­try,” he added. According to the eight-page judgment delivered by the ICAN Disciplinary Tribunal, Otunla has been suspended from mem­bership of the Institute of Char­tered Accountants of Nigeria for a period of 10 years. Additionally, he has been ordered to return his membership certificate and license.
