ABUJA – Former governors of Rivers, Ebonyi and Akwa Ibom states, Nyesom Wike, David Umahi and Senator Godswill Akpabio, on Monday, visited the President, Bola Tinubu, in Aso Rock. Three of the ex-governors were spotted together in the Villa around noon heading to attend a meeting with the President. As at press time, it was not clear what informed their visit to the seat of power but Senator Godswill Akpabio is believed to be one of the favourite candidate of President Tinubu to serve as presiding officer in the 10th Senate. There are indications that the lifespan of the 9th National Assembly will come to an end on June 13th, following which a new leadership will emerge. Both Umahi and Akpabio crossed carpet from the Peoples Democratic Party PDP to the All Progressive Congress APC, where they are now major players in the scheme of things. Wike who was instrumental to the success of Bola Ahmed Tinubu in the 2023 general elections is being speculated to be warming up to join the APC but has not been confirmed. Today’s visit marks the second time Wike is visiting the presidency since Tinubu’s inauguration as President.
