LAGOS  – The Lagos State Traffic Man­agement Authority (LASTMA) has assured Lagosians that traffic personnel will be fully on the ground to professionally and adequately manage traffic before, during and after the fes­tive period. In a press statement signed by the Director, Public Affairs and Enlightenment Depart­ment of LASTMA Mr Ade­bayo Taofiq, quoted Mr Bolaji Oreagba, General Manager of LASTMA as giving the assur­ance during a strategic meeting held with the Comptrollers, Commanders and Zonal Heads at LASTMA Headquarters in Oshodi. Oreagba noted that the ‘Eld-el-kabir celebrations is usually characterised by a high volume of human and vehicular move­ments, hence extra effort would be required to ensure a free flow of vehicle movements across the Lagos metropolis. His words: “All motorists are urged to maintain speed limits as they embark on their jour­neys into, within and outside Lagos. Entry and exit points into Lagos will be fully manned by our officers for adequate control and management of traffic. Major entry/exit roads in Lagos, like Lagos-Ibadan, La­gos-Abeokuta, Lagos-Badagry, Lekki-Epe Expressways and La­gos-Ikorodu-Sagamu Highway would be adequately covered by our personnel for smooth and seamless traffic flow. Major road intersections would not be left out in our strategic coverage to ensure free traffic flow.” The General Manager add­ed that LASTMA officers’ pres­ence would be felt across all the major road intersections with regular and consistent patrols, especially notorious traffic flashpoints, imploring all road users to adhere strictly to the traffic laws, at all times, not only to avoid accidents but to also prevent avoidable arrest and prosecution.
