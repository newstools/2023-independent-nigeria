Arsenal have made an improved bid worth up to £105 million for West Ham midfielder Declan Rice. The offer, which Arsenal hope will fend off rivals Manchester City, comprises an initial fee of £100m and an extra £5m in add-ons. It will be a record fee for a British player if the move materialises. Arsenal had a club-record proposal worth up to £90 million — £75m plus £15m in add-ons — turned down by West Ham earlier this month. Manchester City subsequently lodged a formal offer of an initial £80 million with an extra £10m in add-ons, but that was also rejected. Arsenal have now upped their bid to try and secure manager Mikel Arteta’s top summer target. Rice’s contract at West Ham expires in 2024, with an option for a one-year extension. But West Ham chairman David Sullivan said after the club’s Europa Conference League triumph that he expected the England international to have played his last game for the club, adding that he “wanted to go”. POLL Rice has made 245 appearances for West Ham since making his debut in 2017. (SOURCE: The Athletic)
