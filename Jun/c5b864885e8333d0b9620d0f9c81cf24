The Ogun State Govern­ment has presented schol­arship documents to the state contingents that fin­ished 1st and 3rd out of 148 participants during the 25th edition of the Junior Engi­neers Technicians and Sci­entist Competition (JETS). The scholarship would cover them throughout their ter­tiary education in any gov­ernment-owned institutions in Nigeria. Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Sci­ence and Technology, Mrs. Abosede Ogunleye, while presenting the documents to the first positioned student, Enoch Afenisumen of Great Grace Science Secondary School, Owode-Yewa and the 3rd best, Orebiyi Emmanuel of African Church Gram­mar School, Ita-Eko, Abeo­kuta, noted that the state contingents won eighteen out of the available awards. Mrs. Ogunleye, according to the press officer, Mr. Ayoo­la Obadimu, said since the resuscitation of the state’s participation in JETS in 2019 by the present admin­istration, Ogun had been maintaining the overall best position, commending the governor for his continuous and result-oriented invest­ment in the education sector.
