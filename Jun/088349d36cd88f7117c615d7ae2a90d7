Over 65 students of the Uma Uk­pai Polytechnic, Asaga in Ohafia of Abia State, got scholarship awards courtesy of the Managing Director of PWAN Plus Business Concerns Ltd, owners of Cedar­wood brand of luxury homes, Am­bassador (Dr.) Julius Oyedemi. The academic community was left in absolute awe when the innovative real estate mogul instantly paid off the bills of in­debted students, gifted generous feeding allowance to 54 students, and placed two members of the academic community on a month­ly allowance. Rector of the Polytechnic, Apostle Clement Ogbonna, who confirmed the kind gesture said that Ambassador Oyedemi was the guest speaker at the just-con­cluded 2023 edition of History Maker’s Summit, a flagship event of the Dr. Uma Ukpai Polytechnic. Our correspondent reported that Ambassador Oyedemi, in what was described as an epic lec­ture, took the academic commu­nity into a fascinating three-day journey of positive mind reset. Apostle Ogbonna said: “This year’s History Maker’s Summit saw us in another perspective. Uma Ukpai Polytechnic, Asaga Ohafia kissed heaven on Earth. Dr. Julius Oyedemi is worth hear­ing. His teachings titled ‘Mind Set and Positive Thinking’ left us in awe.
