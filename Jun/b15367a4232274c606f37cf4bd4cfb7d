BENIN – Comrade Philip Shaibu, Edo State Deputy Governor, has reacted to allegations of a pres­sure group known as Afemai Vanguard, accusing him of be­ing responsible for the alleged non-nomination of commis­sioner designates from the three Etsako local government areas of the state. He affirmed that he was not aware of any meeting where the issue of commissioner nomi­nees was discussed. The Afemai Vanguard had in a statement made available to newsmen in Benin City, a few hours after the state governor, Godwin Obaseki sworn in 15 new commissioners, accused the deputy governor of being the brain behind the non-nom­ination of commissioners from the three local governments. The three Etsako local gov­ernments are Etsako West with headquarters in Auchi, Etsako Central, headquarters in Fugar and Etsako East, Agenebode. The statement signed by Harrison Igbafe as the Conve­ner, Afemai Vanguard alleged that the commissioner slots for the three local councils were not filled because the Deputy Gov­ernor of the State, Comrade Philip Shaibu, did not attend the meeting where the commission­er nominees were rectified. Harrison alleged that the meeting was called to reach a consensus on the list of com­missioners from the affected areas.
