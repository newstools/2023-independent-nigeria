The Igbo apex socio-cultural or­ganisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, on Wednesday in Enugu urged the media to desist from publishing statements from unauthorised persons on its behalf. The organisation described the action by some media as un­acceptable and embarrassing. Addressing newsmen on behalf of its President-General, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyan­wu, its National Publicity Sec­retary, Dr. Alex Ogbonnia, said Ohanaeze Ndigbo condemned the act in its entirety. He spoke after the group’s Na­tional Executive Council meeting. “Some Igbo youth groups is­sue statements in the name of Ohanaeze Ndigbo surprisingly, journalists accept it from them in spite of the organisation’s dis­claimer that they do not represent the interest of Igbo people. “But we continue to see them in the press and the Presi­dent-General of Ohanaeze Ndig­bo has made it clear that anybody has the right to belong to a politi­cal group or champion whatever interest. “But using the name of Ohanaeze Ndigbo is deplorable and despicable, especially on the issues they canvass. “They do it for some selfish reasons and Ohanaeze Ndigbo condemns that,” Ogbonnia said. POLL He further said the Ohanaeze agreed to hold Igbo Day annual­ly on every September 29, adding that the committees for that had been inaugurated. The president-general also said that another committee was inaugurated to harmonise some of the cultures in Igboland by unifying them into a central Igbo culture.
