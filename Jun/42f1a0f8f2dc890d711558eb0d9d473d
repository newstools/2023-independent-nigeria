The United States government has assured the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, ND­LEA, of more support and collab­oration in different areas of its strategic operations to enhance its capabilities against substance abuse and illicit drug trafficking in Nigeria. The assurance was given by Dr. Mark Hove of the Africa and Middle East Office, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, US State De­partment, on Wednesday 1st June when he led another top official of the Bureau, Craig Nixon on a courtesy visit to the Chairman/ Chief Executive Officer of ND­LEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) at the Agency’s headquarters in Abuja. This comes on the heels of a recent official letter by the Bu­reau announcing the U.S. project grant to the NDLEA following re­quests by Gen. Marwa during a series of meetings both in Abuja and in Washington DC. The letter had noted that the support grant which will be implemented by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Nigeria, covers forensic and chemical analysis capacity of the Agency, intelligence-led investigations through diverse resources as well as legal books and an e-library for prosecution and other legal needs of the Agency. Speaking during the visit on Wednesday, Mark Hove commend­ed the tremendous work done so far by the Marwa-led NDLEA while expressing satisfaction with the response of the Agency to the threat of lethal illicit drugs such as Fentanyl, Captagon and Methamphetamine. He cited the recent seizure of over 2.1 tons of cocaine in the Ikorodu area of Lagos by NDLEA as an incred­ible feat. Hove said he came on the visit to discuss areas of more assistance for the Agency and fur­ther collaboration. He said with the NDLEA success story, the Agency is well positioned to be a training centre for other anti-nar­cotic agencies in Africa.
