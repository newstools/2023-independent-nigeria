LOKOJA  – An Ibadan-based businessman, Dr. Akeem Olayinka-Martins, has expressed agony over his wife’s refusal to return home from a vacation over an alleged threat to their children’s lives. Olayinka-Martins, a re­nowned real estate broker, said that his wife, Funmilayo Olayinka-Martins and three of their children, Abisola, Abio­dun, and Omotara all travelled to the UK on holiday a few weeks shortly after his moth­er, a prominent traditionalist, passed away. “During the funeral rites, one of our daughters was scheduled to take over the stool, being a virgin, as a replacement for her position and the custodi­an of the tradition to which we vehemently disagreed. “This was an elders’ tradi­tion that was not known to us while she lived. We believe that such a practice was archaic and against our religious beliefs as Christians,” he stated He said, “Despite our dis­agreement, there is much pressure on me to produce the girl and my visit to the UK for this purpose did not yield any result as my wife insisted she would not allow anyone subject our innocent daugh­ter to such a diabolical ritual procedures. “I have since been lost in thought as to what to do.”
