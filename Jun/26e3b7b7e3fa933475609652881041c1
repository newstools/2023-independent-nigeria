LAGOS  – The Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (AN­LCA) has called for the support of Benjamin Okezie Kalu’s bid to clinch the deputy speaker po­sition of the House of Represen­tatives. This followed the zoning for­mula released by the National Working Committee (NWC) of the ruling All Progressives Con­gress (APC) after consulting Pres­ident Bola Tinubu who identified Ben Kalu, Member of House of Representatives (Bende, Abia) Federal Constituency as Deputy Speaker designate of the House of Representatives in the 10th Assembly. To this end, more and more na­tional stakeholders from different sectors have been applauding the ruling party for making a very good choice. ANLCA in a statement re­leased by Barr. Val Iwuchukwu, Media and Public Affairs to the President, extolled the virtue of Kalu. He said: “It is a geometrical axiom to state that when one straight line falls perpendicular with another straight line that lies horizontal, the angles formed are supplementary angles of one hundred and eighty degrees, therefore the choice of Ben Kalu as Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives is a round peg in a round hole.” Kalu was elected to represent Bende Federal Constituency, Abia State in the 2019 general elections and sworn into office on the 11th of June, 2019.
