The National Drug Law Enforce­ment Agency (NDLEA) has de­nied some reports making the rounds that the agency carried out lopsided promotion of staff. In a press statement signed by Femi Babafemi, the director of media and advocacy of the agency and made available to the press, the NDLEA denied any such exercise. The press statement said: “The attention of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agen­cy (NDLEA) has been drawn to some online reports suggesting lopsided promotion of person­nel. The agency wishes to state that no such thing exists as eleva­tion of officers and men remains an ongoing exercise based on a number of factors including va­cancy. “Indeed, the issues raised by the category of personnel men­tioned in the reports arose in 2011, which was 10 clear years before the current leadership of Brig. Gen. MB Marwa (Retd). “However, in a determined bid to motivate the workforce, over 70% of the workforce, a number of who had been stag­nated on one rank for 15-20 years, were promoted and their ranks harmonized in 2021 soon after Gen. Marwa assumed leadership of the agency. “Even though more than half of the category of personnel re­ferred to in the reports had been promoted in the recent promo­tion exercises, the ongoing ex­pansion of the agency which cre­ates more vacancies for officers and men to move up, no doubt provides the window for the few not yet affected to be elevated in another exercise underway for the junior ranks.”
