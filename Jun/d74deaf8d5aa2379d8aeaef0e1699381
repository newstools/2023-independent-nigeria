As Nigerians marked this year’s Democracy Day on June 12, 2023, Archbishop Daniel Okoh, President, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), has exhorted Nigerians to imbibe the lesson of June 12 for democracy to thrive in the country. Archbishop Oko, in a statement issued to mark the event, acknowledged the sacrifices made by the nation’s past heroes, who fought for democracy in the land. The top cleric maintained that their struggles and sacrifices paved the way for the democratic government which nIgerians enjoy today. “We must never forget their efforts and their contributions to our freedom,” he stressed. Archbishop Okoh stated: “On this day, we also remember the annulment of the free and fair election of Chief Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola as president on June 12, 1993. “This event was a watershed in our nation’s history, and it reminds us of the need to uphold the principles of democracy, justice, and fairness at all times as responsible citizens. “As Nigerians, we must learn from the lessons of June 12 and strive to build a nation where democracy is truly entrenched. “We must put aside our religious and cultural differences and work towards the common goal of a better Nigeria. POLL “Our leaders must prioritise the needs of the people and ensure that they are accountable to the citizens they serve. “Furthermore, as we celebrate Democracy Day, we must recognise that there is still much work to be done. We need to address the issues of insecurity, corruption, poverty, and unemployment in our country. “These problems affect all Nigerians and must be tackled with urgency and sincerity. “I call on all Nigerians to play their part in advancing the development of our nation. “We must all be responsible citizens and work towards building a better future for ourselves and the next generations. “Let us continue to pray for our nation and work together towards a brighter future. God bless Nigeria.”
