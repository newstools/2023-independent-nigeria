ABUJA – President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Archbishop Dan­iel Okoh, has charged leaders to prioritize the needs of the people and ensure that they are accountable to the citizens they serve. He also urged them to put aside religious and cultural dif­ferences and work towards the common goal of a better Nigeria. The CAN president made this known in his message to mark this year’s Democracy Day on June 12, saying that Nigerians must learn from the lessons of June 12 and strive to build a na­tion where democracy is truly entrenched. The message reads: “Further­more, as we celebrate Democracy Day, we must recognize that there is still much work to be done. We need to address the issues of in­security, corruption, poverty, and unemployment in our country. These problems affect all Nige­rians and must be tackled with urgency and sincerity. “As we mark this year’s De­mocracy Day on June 12, I want to acknowledge the sacrifices made by our past heroes who fought for democracy in our land. Their struggles and sacrifices have paved the way for the democratic government we enjoy today. We must never forget their efforts and their contributions to our freedom. “On this day, we also remem­ber the annulment of the free and fair election of Chief Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola as president on June 12, 1993. This event was a watershed in our na­tion’s history, and it reminds us of the need to uphold the principles of democracy, justice, and fairness at all times as responsible citizens. “I call on all Nigerians to play their part in advancing the devel­opment of our nation. We must all be responsible citizens and work towards building a better future for ourselves and the next gen­erations. Let us continue to pray for our nation and work together towards a brighter future.”
