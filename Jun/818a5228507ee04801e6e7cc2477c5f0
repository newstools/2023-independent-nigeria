LAGOS  – The emergence of Telecommunication has brought a new era in communication industry. The internet, mobile phone and computer, have brought about a fundamental shift in patterns of communication and human relationships. Communication revolution has also brought about amazing social, economic, cultural and psychological transformation. It has reduced the globe into a village through reduction of time and space. These recent advances in telecommunications technology have been an important vehicle in permitting information exchange to develop as a valuable commodity for moving the country into post-industrial and information based economic growth. In this present world, a modern telecommunication infrastructural development is not only essential for domestic economic growth, but is a prerequisite for participation in increasingly competitive world markets and for attracting new investments. Nigeria today has not been left out of rapid development of telecommunication industry in the world. The nation’s telecommunication industry was liberated with the return of democracy in 1999. This led to the granting of Global System for Mobile Telecommunication (GSM) licences by the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) to three providers: Econet, MTN, and M-tel. This was followed by the licensing of the Second National Operator (SNO), in 2003; that is, Globacom and Universal Access Service licenses of 2006 which include fixed telephony, VSAT and internet service providers. Also, in March 2008, the NCC gave license to another GSM operator known as Etisalat (now 9mobile) There is no gainsaying to the fact that telecommunication is an essential component of the economic infrastructure, fostering productivity and economic growth. The Nigerian economy has been driven by gains made in the oil and gas sector. Although Nigeria has clearly made great gains from her abundance of oil, it is clear that oil is a non-sustainable resource and in order to ensure effective industrialized economy, Nigeria must look away from her oil sector and consider the growth and gains that can be culled in her other sectors. The Telecommunications growth and explosion is a clear indication that there is much gain to be harnessed from this critical sector. POLL According to the industry’s regulator in a recent statistics, in the first quarter 2023, telecom sector delivered a handsome N2.508 trillion in terms of financial value contribution to the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP), representing 14.13 per cent. Figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that the sector recorded a 4.3 per cent. increase from its performance in the last quarter of 2022 when it recorded 13.55 per cent. . When compared on a year-on-year basis, the growth showed positive progression from 12.94 per cent. in the first quarter of 2022, to the 2023 figure of 14.13, which is an approximate growth by 9.19 per cent. . The percentage of telecom contribution to GDP was calculated from 46 distinct sectors of the economy, which constitute telecom and information services baskets. The Nigerian telecom industry has continued its show of positive outlook, which is credited to the innovative and predictable telecom regulatory environment promoted, and implemented by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). One of the key highlights of the telecom industry performance within the period was the generation of $820.8 million for the federal government from 5G spectrum licences fees paid by three eventual winning operators, MTN, MAFAB and Airtel. Following the issuance of the licences in December 2021 to MTN and MAFAB, both companies have launched 5G services. Airtel, which received its licence in December 2022, is set to launch services this month, June 2023. Another major development in the sector was the launch of Starlinks broadband services, a satellite-based wireless broadband services with potential nationwide coverage. This followed the issuance of licence to Elon Musk-owned SpaceX by the Commission. The services are now available in different parts of the country. Meanwhile, the growth statistics of the telecom industry are showing an impressive record of contributions to the economy. The number of phone subscribers as at April 2023, stood at 223.6 million subscribers, scoring a teledensity of 117 per cent. Internet subscribers for the same period were 157 million while Broadband subscriptions stood at 92 million, translating to 48 per cent broadband penetration in the country. In 2022, telecom operators stood tall to count their many achievements, which they said have impacted the Nigerian economy, including individuals and organisations in several ways, despite the challenges it faced with government agencies in some states that imposed all manners of levies and taxes on telecom operations. Social miscreants, who were bent on milking the telecom sector dry, also faced operators with unnecessary monetary demands and willful destruction of telecom facilities. Despite the challenges faced in 2021, the telecom operators, the industry regulator and the former Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, unanimously acknowledged that the telecom sector raised the Nigerian Gross Domestic Product (GDP), created job opportunities and sustained the Nigerian economy by cushioning the effect of COVID pandemic on the economy. In his view, the Association of Licensed Telecom Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) Chairman, Engr. Gbenga Adebayo, explained that the telecom sector has contributed immensely to the country’s economy. “The telecom industry in 2022 impacted a lot of sectors of the Nigerian economy and will continue to do so. It also supported the financial sector in ensuring that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) achieved its financial inclusion goals for the country. The Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) being offered by the telecom is a perfect example of the role of the industry. The threat by the service providers to deactivate the USSD service over huge debt banks are owing them is causing fears among banks’ customers and the financial sector as a whole. The telecoms sector also supported the Fintech in disrupting the financial sector, especially the banks,” Adebayo said. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released data on sector contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 2022, the telecom sector contributed 12.12 per cent to total nominal GDP and 18.44 per cent to total real GDP in the second quarter of 2022. Telecom and information services are the major components of the sector. Of the sector’s total nominal GDP contribution in the first two quarter of 2022, telecom contributed 76.29 per cent, and 79.49 per cent to its total real GDP contribution. Explaining the sector’s impact on the economy, NBS said, “In nominal terms, in the second quarter of 2022, the sector growth was recorded at 14.11 per cent (year-on-year), 14.18 per cent points increase from the rate of -0.07 per cent recorded in the same quarter of 2021, and 6.43 per cent points lower than the rate recorded in the preceding quarter. The quarter-on-quarter growth rate recorded in the second quarter of 2022 was 14.13 per cent. The Information and Communications sector contributed 12.12 per cent to the total nominal GDP in the 2022 second quarter, lower than the rate of 12.22 per cent recorded in the same quarter of 2021 and higher than the 10.55 per cent it contributed in the preceding quarter. The sector in the second quarter of 2022 recorded a growth rate of 6.55 per cent in real terms, year-on-year. From the rate recorded in the corresponding period of 2021, there was an increase of 0.99 percentage points. Quarter-on-quarter, the sector exhibited a growth of 13.41 per cent in real terms. Of total real GDP, the sector contributed 18.44 per cent in 2022 second quarter, higher than in the same quarter of the previous year in which it represented 17.92 per cent and higher than the preceding quarter in which it represented 16.20 per cent. Broadband penetration in Nigeria increased from six per cent in August 2015 to 48.21 per cent by March 2023. NCC EVC said the communication sector contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), increased from 8.5 per cent in 2015 to 13.55 per cent at the end of the 4th quarter 2022. He said communications technology is the most effective tool of expanding the boundaries of financial inclusion in Nigeria. According to Danbata, active voice subscription also increased from about 151 million to 226.2 million while internet subscriptions increased from about 95 million to approximately 158 million in March 2023. He said: “NCC through the implementation of initiatives, projects, effective stakeholder collaboration and policies led broadband penetration from 6% in August 2015 to 48.21 per cent by March 2023. This has enhanced the growth in the telecoms sector especially in the contribution to the nation’s gross domestic product. “The sectors contribution to the GDP increased from 8.5 per cent in 2015 to 13.55 per cent by the end of the 4th quarter in 2022. It is noteworthy that for the same period, active voice subscription also increased from about 151 million to 226.2 million. While internet subscriptions increased from about 95 million to approximately 158 million in March 2023.” Teledensity has also grown significantly from 107.87 per cent in 2015 to 118.48 per cent as of March 2023, he stated. In spite of the uncommon feat achieved by the sector, the NCC said it would continue to focus on the implementation of federal government policies and plans that will foster a digital economy and financial inclusion. “The NCC supports government’s drive and initiatives towards promoting a digital economy that will support national development and economic diversification,” he said. The NCC, in collaboration with the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, in 2021, commenced the process of auctioning 5G spectrum licence and concluded it in 2022, after it issued 5G licence to MTN Nigeria Plc and Mafab Communications Limited. The deployment of 5G services is in line with the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) 2020 – 2030, National Policy on Fifth Generation (5G) Networks for Nigeria’s Digital Economy and in fulfilment of one of the key initiatives of the Nigerian National Broadband Plan 2020-2025 (NNBP).
