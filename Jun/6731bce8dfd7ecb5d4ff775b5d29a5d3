The newly appointed Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Vice Marshal Hassan Abubakar, on Thursday, assumed office as the 22nd air chief as Air Marshal Oladayo Amao bowed out of the service. Until his appointment, the new CAS was the Chief of Stan­dards and Evaluation at Air Force Headquarters. In his maiden speech, Abu­bakar appreciated the Almighty God for the unique privilege to lead the Nigerian Air Force at this crucial time in the life of the nation. He said his appointment came at a time that the expectations of Nigerians towards accelerated actualisation of peace and security was high. ­ Abubakar said NAF under his command would reinvigo­rate the fight against terrorism, insurgency, banditry and a host of other challenges bedeviling the country. He promised to sustain the co­operation and joint efforts that existed between the Air Force and sister services during the tenure of the outgoing service chiefs, adding that it was respon­sible for the successes achieved in the various theatres of oper­ations. “In conjunction with my col­leagues, we will uphold these attributes in line with Mr. Pres­ident’s directive issued during the maiden National Security Council meeting. “We shall also begin to make additional efforts and evolve measures and approaches that will continue to diminish our challenges and enhance the dis­position of our various theatres of operations,” he said. POLL The new CAS congratulated his predecessor for his achieve­ments and distinguished career in the military and pledged to continue to build on his legacies, as well as do more to move NAF to higher heights.
