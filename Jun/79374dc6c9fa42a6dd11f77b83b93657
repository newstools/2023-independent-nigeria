ABUJA  – The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has urged religious leaders and follow­ers to promote interfaith dialogue and peaceful co­existence for a harmonious Nigeria. This is coming as the Christian body condemned the brutal killing of Usman Buda, a butcher, by religious extremists in Sokoto over an alleged blasphemous com­ment. In a statement personally signed by CAN President, Archbishop Daniel Okoh, a copy of which was made available to newsmen on Thursday in Abuja, he said CAN firmly believes in the freedom of religion and the peaceful expression of be­liefs. The statement read: “We extend our heartfelt con­dolences to the family and friends of the deceased. “According to reports reaching us, Usman Buda was brutally murdered over an alleged blasphemous comment. “We, therefore, denounce any form of violence or jun­gle justice in the name of religion. “This tragic incident un­derscores the urgent need for increased efforts to foster re­ligious tolerance, peace, and unity in our diverse society. “CAN will continue to advocate for the protection of all citizens’ rights, re­gardless of their religious affiliations. POLL “Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Usman Buda during this difficult time”.
