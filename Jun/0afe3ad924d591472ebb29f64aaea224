ENUGU  – Media practitioners and the Ministry of Education have been enjoined to build an education campaign in Enugu, Benue and Cross River states to enhance more registration of children on Nigeria Learning Passport (NLP). The charge was given by Chief of United Nations Children’s Education Fund (UNICEF) Enu­gu Field Office, Juliet Chiluwe, during a one-day meeting to deter­mine the key initiatives on how to achieve uptake of NLP in com­munities, schools, LGAs, hard to reach areas, and for all persons living in difficult circumstances organised by the Enugu State Universal Basic Education Board and the Enugu State Ministry of Education, in collaboration with UNICEF. A one-day media dialogue held in Enugu on communications results was to arouse interest of teachers, students and other stakeholders on NLP. Nigeria Learning Passport is an online e-learning platform with mobile and offline capability that enables continuous access to quality education. The platform provides learn­ers with high quality and inter­active content based on grades. Learners can access self-paced modules for basic and secondary education courses, early literacy and mathematics, social studies, social emotional learning, child development, and social inclusion for early childhood educators. According to Chiluwe, the media dialogue was aimed at ac­quainting journalists’ networks in three states on the NLP model and its potential for educational advancement among the children. The three states, which are Enugu, Benue and Cross River, are among the eight states under the Enugu Field Office of the in­ternational organization. Represented by Agatha Nzeri­be, Education Specialist, UNICEF Enugu Field Office, Chiluwe stat­ed that NLP is a new solution de­signed to close learning gaps in the country.
