LAGOS  – Freight forwarding agents have counselled the Federal Govern­ment against the attempted merger of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), the Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) and the Federal Inland Revenue Ser­vice into the Nigerian Revenue Service (NRS). The clearing agents warned that this may lead to adminis­trative catastrophe for the gov­ernment if not well-thought out. Speaking under the auspic­es of the Africa Association of Professional Freight Forward­ers and Logistics of Nigeria (APFFLON), the clearing agents declared that the merger of the three agencies of government may encourage corruption and create unnecessary bottlenecks in the system. Otunba Frank Ogunojemite, President of APFFLON, told journalists in Lagos that it may also create more bottlenecks for the full implementation of ease-of-doing business in the country. Ogunojemite advised the Federal Government to assem­ble a team of experts before implementing the numerous recommendations before it. He said: “President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s administra­tion must not fail to assemble experts to x-ray every economic policy to know how best it would benefit the country before its implementation. He must not sacrifice good governance on the altar of nepotism. “We need round pegs in round holes if at all we sincere­ly need to progress as a nation. I believe that the council means well, but the merger will not yield positive results. “The policy will impede ease of doing business as process requirements could become cumbersome. The policy can as well negatively affect the Af­rican Continental Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) and even jeopardise the single window policy of the Nigeria Customs.” POLL Ogunojemite further ad­vised the committee to seek stakeholders’ before submitting their recommendations to the presidency. He also said that it was im­portant to consider the inputs of the 2019 International Monetary Fund (IMF) report on the econo­my and Nigerian ports reforms.
