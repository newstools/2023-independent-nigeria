LOKOJA – There was wide jubilations across the ancient town of Kotonkarfe in Kogi Local Government Area as the Hydroelectric Power Producing Development Commission (HYPPADEC) is set to hand over the 620 meters River Akpankiti channel project to the people in order to mitigate the yearly flooding in the area. The people who could not hold back their joy when the officials of the Hyppadec on Saturday inspected the multi million naira drainage control project in Kotonkarfe. Speaking on behalf of the community, Chief Umar Adam commended the management of Hyppadec and the Federal Government for coming to the aid of the community to construct a concrete channel on the Akpankiti River, which runs through the town. He said the establishment of Hyppadec was a blessing to the community which has tamed the monster of flooding caused by the river that has been destroying their property, causing traffic logjam as it often overflowed its bank into the Kotonkarfe section of the Abuja- Lokoja highway. He added that with the commitment of the management and the contractor to its early completion, the people were hopeful that the predicted 2023 flooding would not cause havoc for the community. He appealed to the management of Hyppadec under the leadership of the managing director, Alhaji Abubakar Sadiq Yelwa, to as a matter of urgency approve the construction of concrete lining of the remaining sections of the channel. Meanwhile, the consultant to the commission, Engineer Abubakar Mohammed Dakingari, has assured the people that the project would be delivered earlier than scheduled, stressing that the work had achieved 78% completion. He said the first phase of the contract was 620 meters, both for excavation and desilting, while some specific areas would be concrete lining with 6 meter by I.5 meters high, stressing that without the dumping of refuse in the drains by the community, the menace of floods will be a thing of the past in the town. POLL He said based on the budget approved for the project, the contract was planned to do concrete lining of 160meters over the length of the drains which will be separated in so many sections in a sense that the adjoining structures, culvert and areas prone to heavy erosion, would be concrete lined. According to him, what was supposed to be done to control the floods had been done by clearing the waterways to enable free flow of water into the River Niger which will no longer pose a threat to the community
