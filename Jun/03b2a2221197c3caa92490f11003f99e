ABEOKUTA – Hon Olakunle Oluomo, member of the Ogun State House of Assembly representing Ifo I State Constituency, has been reelected as the Speaker of the Amosun during a tension-soaked session. The event, which was billed to start by 10am, did not start until 1:48pm when the clerk, Deji Adeyemo, called the House to order. The same event had been postponed for a week, because of the politics of the leadership of the Assembly, but the one week extension could not douse the tension. After about four hours of delay, the Clerk of the Assembly called for nominations for the election to the office of speaker and deputy speaker. Lamidi Musefiu from Ado-Odo Ota state constituency II nominated the immediate past speaker, and was seconded by Olowode Ifedayo from Ijebu East state constituency. In the absence of further nominations, the clerk declared Mr Oluomo as speaker elected unopposed. The deputy speaker, Ajayi Bolanle from Yewa South State constituency was nominated by Bakare Oluwayemisi and was also seconded by Odunuga Kaka.
