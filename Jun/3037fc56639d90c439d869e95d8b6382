During the media interaction, Charles Douglas Opoku Fordjour addressed the allegations, stating, “I am a man who has consistently maintained a clear reputation. Integrity has always been my watchword as a businessman, and it has been instrumental in propelling me towards success in all my business ventures.” Expressing disappointment over the attempts to tarnish his image, Charles added, “It is disheartening that some individuals would seek to undermine my reputation out of envy. I have been primarily engaged in the sugar business and other general contracts. If I were truly guilty, I would be serving my sentence by now. However, I firmly believe in the competence of the Ghanaian judiciary system, which has recognized my innocence.” Regarding the specifics of the case, Charles Douglas Opoku Fordjour refuted the prosecution’s claims.

Charles found it amusing that someone he had never dealt with, such as the complainant named Bruce, would make such accusations against him. Highlighting the apparent motivations behind the accusations, Charles stated, “This individual sought to exploit the legal system, naively believing that framing me through baseless accusations would secure a victory for him. However, his plot failed when he realized it was futile, leading to the withdrawal of the case. This serves as a testament to my innocence.”. However, the merits of the case were totally fabricated as there was no fraud nor intention of a fraudulent act in any way. Expressing his dismay at the coverage of the case by certain online platforms, Charles Douglas Opoku Fordjour criticized their lack of investigation and research. He stated, “It is unfortunate that some of these unscrupulous online platforms have published unsubstantiated information, seeking to tarnish the reputation I have painstakingly built over the years. POLL “They irresponsibly carried a case that the court dismissed due to its lack of merit and evidence. I am currently consulting with my lawyer to determine the appropriate legal action against these news platforms. I maintain my innocence, and the court has vindicated me.” As Charles Douglas Opoku Fordjour maintains his innocence and awaits the resolution of his legal matters, he remains focused on upholding his reputation as a businessman of integrity.
