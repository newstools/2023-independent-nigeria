Lionel Messi spurned FC Barcelona this summer as the 35-year-old intends to sign with Inter Miami once his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expires on June 30. Many people are giving their opinions on the matter, including Carlos Tevez. The former Manchester United goal scorer explained why he believes Messi opted not to wait, sign with the Spanish club, and return to Camp Nou. If the 2022 FIFA World Cup winner were going to return to Barcelona, various players would have either had to exit or possibly take a pay cut. As a result, Tevez argues saw Messi opted for the United States not to cause a rift upon arriving at the Catalan side. “He didn’t want to go back to Barcelona and see his teammates cut their wages so he could come,” Tevez told ESPN (h/t GOAL France). “He didn’t want to be the bad guy. It hurt him more than anyone not being able to return to Barcelona, which is his home. I think everything was very lukewarm from Barça.” Messi will join the South Florida-based club in a few weeks and be tasked with growing the sport in the United States. Furthermore, the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner also might have to expand the presence of MLS outside of North America.
