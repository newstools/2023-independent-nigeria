Gunmen suspected to be armed bandits, who abducted over 57 people from Kafin-Koro, Adunu and Kwagana villages in Paikoro Local Government Area on the 14th of March 2023 have issued one-week deadline for families to pay a ransom or have them killed. This is coming as family members of the remaining victims are calling on Governor Mohammed Umar Bago, good-spirited individuals and corporate organisations to come to their aid in saving the lives of their loved ones from being killed by the armed men. The victims including women and children were thereafter taken through the forest in Sarkin pawa, headquarters of Munya local government area by the armed men who have been demanding for cash, food items and other materials before they can regain their freedom. Daily Independent learnt that the gunmen had initially demanded N100m ransom for the release of all of them, but later changed their mind and started negotiating individually with the families of each of their captives. Already, the gunmen according to a relative to one of the victims have so far received the sum of, N32.7 million as ransom from different families who paid different sums of money depending on their bargaining power and the individuals involved. The relative told our correspondent, “Some of us sold our personal belongings to be able to raise the N32.7 million paid to them, and this is aside from various food items and motorcycles and other things they asked us to bring before they can release our loved ones who have been in captivity for months now”. While some families paid between N2 million to N4 million to secure freedom for their loved ones, others who are not as financially buoyant paid between N600,000 and N700,000 before they issued a fresh one-week ultimatum for them to either pay the ransom or have the remaining ones killed because they (bandits) can no longer feed them. The relative who said he could not tell exactly the number of people still in captivity is pleading with the state government, good-spirited individuals and cooperating organisations to come to their aid in saving the lives of the remaining captives before the one-week deadline expires.
