Roberto Firmino is closing in on a move to Saudi Arabian side Al-Ahli. According to Fabrizio Romano, the Brazilian striker has a three-year contract on the table, but is expected to sign the deal. The forward has been looking for a club since announcing his plan to leave Liverpool at the end of last term. Firmino scored 111 goals in 362 appearances for the Reds, but will leave the Premier League for a new challenge in the middle-east. However it looks like he won’t be alone at his new club, with Edouard Mendy set to join him. The Chelsea goalkeeper was deemed surplus to requirements following the appointment of Mauricio Pochettino. With the Blues keen to bring in a new shot-stopper of their own, Mendy has sought a new challenge with a switch to Al-Ahli also on the cards for him. The 31-year-old will be the third Chelsea player to leave for Saudi Arabia this summer, with N’Golo Kante and Kalidou Koulibaly having joined Al Ittihad and Al Hilal already this summer. POLL Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves has also completed a move to Al Hilal, while several other Premier League stars have been linked with a move to the Saudi Pro League. These include Hakim Ziyech, Bernardo Silva and Wilfried Zaha, while other stars are likely to consider the prospect of a move as the summer progresses.
