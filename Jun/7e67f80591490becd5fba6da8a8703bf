Mrs. Tomi Somefun, the Managing Director/CEO of Unity Bank Plc, while commenting on the financial statements, noted that the bank’s focus on building back momentum continues to reflect in the key performance indicators despite economic headwinds and volatilities that characterized the operating environment in the 2022 financial year. “There are highs and lows as we look at the gross earnings, with 13.7 per cent growth, increase in liquid assets by 7.5 per cent and deposits recording moderate growth of 1.6 per cent, while maintaining steady growth in profitability”, she stated. “Overall, the financial statement thus threw up both strong and less optimal points which inform the outlook for our business”, she further stated. She reassures that going into the new financial year, the Bank will remain laser-focused on our strategic choices and key growth drivers to push all the indices and elevate growth to double-digit territory. “The performance posted for Q1 ‘23 in terms of the PBT, gross earnings, and other key indicators are strong reinforcement of adequate measures being adopted and a testament of our resolve to sustain and equally improve upon the fundamental initiatives adopted to strengthen growth throughout the course of the financial year”, Mrs. Somefun stated. She further said: “Since late 2022, the Bank has begun significant investment in technology and innovation in line with its strategic pursuits to win in the retail space with our focus on digital and lifestyle banking, dynamic product development, and accelerated onboarding. As part of our transformation journey, we will double down on these investments in the coming months in order to achieve our aspirations of significantly reducing customer pain points and simplifying customer experience; increasing the rate of customer acquisition; expanding the frontiers of partnerships; and ultimately developing new and sustainable income lines for the Bank.”
