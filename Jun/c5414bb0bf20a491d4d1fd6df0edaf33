ABUJA – Senator Agom Jarigbe (PDP Ogoja/Yala Federal Constituency) has decried reports of plans by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to foist a minority leader of opposition political parties in the Senate. Speaking on Arise TV’s flagship programme, “The Morning Show,” Senator Jarigbe said that it was the duty of opposition lawmakers to nominate a minority leader, and not the task of the APC to do so. He however frowned at the inability of the parties to produce a consensus nominee with five days left until the reconvening of the 10th National Assembly, saying that they must blame themselves if the ruling party foist a minority leader on them. APC has 59 seats in the Upper Chamber, PDP 36, LP 8, SDP and NNPP have two seats respectively. The Lawmaker also used the occasion of the TV show to dispel reports that he was nominated to be the new minority leader, as he described it as “unfounded.” “I have also read reports in the newspaper that I was chosen to be the minority leader. I want to say that the report is unfounded. Nobody has consulted me for such a thing, even though I am eminently qualified for it,” he added. The composition of the membership of the 10th Senate finalised, the six opposition parties have altogether 50 senators-elect as against APC’s 59. The Red Chamber is expected to resume sitting on July 4, after it went into recession to mark the Eid celebration and to allow its committee on welfare to allocate offices and other welfare concerns to lawmakers.
