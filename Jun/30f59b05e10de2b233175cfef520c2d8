A former acting governor of Bayelsa State, Mr Nestor Binabo, is dead. Already, the state governor, Douye Diri, has described the passing of Binabo as sad. Binabo, who was acting governor for a brief period between January 27 and February 14, 2012, passed on Thursday morning after a protracted illness. He also held other political offices, including being a Commissioner for Youth and Conflict Resolution, Deputy Speaker, Acting Speaker and Speaker of the Bayelsa House of Assembly where he represented Sagbama constituency III. Diri in a condolence message issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah, said that Binabo was a grassroots politician and would be greatly missed in the politics of the state. He also said Binabo contributed his quota to the development of the state and left at God’s ordained time, having battled to stay alive. Dir urged his immediate and political families to accept his demise as the will of God and be consoled by his great impact in the politics and development of the state. He equally prayed God to grant his family the fortitude to bear the loss. POLL The governor said, “It is sad that the state has lost a former acting governor, foremost legislator and formidable grassroots politician. “No one can question God why it happened. Everyone has an appointed time. “I urge his family to be comforted by his exemplary role in politics and his impact in the development of Bayelsa.
