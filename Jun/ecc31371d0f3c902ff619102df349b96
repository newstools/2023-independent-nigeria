ABUJA  – Dr. Vincent Olatunji, National Commis­sioner/Chief Exec­utive Officer of the Nigeria Data Protection Bu­reau (NDPB), has said that Ni­geria’s Data Protection Sector is valued at N5.5 billion. Olatunji, who stated this on Wednesday in Abuja during the executive session at the Nigeria-Netherlands Economic Consultation, said Nigeria takes the lead in data protection in Africa with over 200 million population of Ni­geria. The National Commis­sioner explained the major significance of the Bureau to the contribution of Nige­ria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He said: “The EU countries have gone ahead with Data Protection but Nigeria gains the lead in Africa with over 200 million people. “We have put in place ap­propriate structure to create confidence and trust in what­ever you are doing with us in terms of trade and commerce, because one of the objectives of the NDPR is to increase the global competitiveness of businesses in the country. “We have a combined earn­ing of N5.5bn in the sector, which is contributing to our GDP.” Olatunji further guaran­teed that the personal data of the Dutch citizens is safe in Nigeria since appropriate safeguards have been put in place through the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation and the establishment of the Nigeria Data Protection Bu­reau by the Federal Govern­ment. He requested partnership in the area of peer review in implementing data protec­tion regulations and laws be­tween the two countries and other areas, adding that “we are happy to work with you in the area of awareness and capacity building and spread­ing the gospel of data protec­tion because it is the key, the bedrock of the global digital economy.” POLL The event was well at­tended by Delegates from the Netherlands’ Foreign Affairs, Chief Executive Officers from Ministry Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of govern­ment as well as the organised private sector.
