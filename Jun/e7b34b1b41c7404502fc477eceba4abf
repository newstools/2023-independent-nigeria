Former Kwara United defend­er, Sunday Akinmoladun has ended his long-term romance with Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) side Niger Tor­nadoes FC after his contract ended at the just concluded season. The experienced defender, who made 17 appearances for the Abubakar Bala side last season, says he is yet to decide on his next move. “I’m yet to decide on my next move,” said Akinmoladun. “I just want to enjoy the break and see what happens before the start of next season.” Akinmoladun joined the Ikon Allah boys from Kaduna United at the beginning of the 2016/2017 league season. He later moved to Kwara United in the 2018/2019 season before returning to Tornadoes in 2019. Akinmoladun, while reflect­ing on his journey with Niger Tornadoes, says the time has come for him to seek new ad­ventures. “My contract with Niger Tornadoes ended at the end of the 2022-2023 football season,” Akinmoladun explained. “It’s now time for me to seek new adventures elsewhere in my career. I have fond memo­ries here but as a footballer, you always want to take your game to the next level. POLL The former Kaduna United defender also says that he has hopes of playing aboard if a deal shows up for him that looks acceptable. “I’m open to playing outside the shores of the country but like I said, I just want to enjoy my break and see what holds for me in the coming days,” Akinmoladun maintained. Niger Tornadoes finished sixth in the log in Group B with 23 points from 18 games played, winning six, drew five and lost seven.
