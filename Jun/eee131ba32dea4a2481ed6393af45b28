Ecobank, the leading pan-African banking Group, through its representative office in Ethiopia, has partnered with Ethiopia’s Dashen Bank to enable Ethiopians living in the diaspora, specifically Europe, to send money instantly to any Dashen Bank account, other local bank accounts, mobile money wallet and cash pick up using Ecobank’s Rapidtransfer International app (RTI). The cross-border remittance solution app which is available in the rest of Ecobank’s 33 countries, enables the African diaspora residing in Europe to remit funds back to Ecobank countries in Africa, including Ethiopia seamlessly. Dr. James Kanagwa, Ecobank Ethiopia Country Representative, said: “As the bank with the largest geographical footprint across Africa and a recognized leader in digital, mobile and borderless banking, we are delighted to partner with Dashen Bank to empower Ethiopians living in the European-based diaspora countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the Netherlands and 21 other European countries with access to our Rapidtransfer International app which enables Africans in Europe to send money back home affordably, instantly and securely.” The Rapidtransfer International app is secure, easy to onboard and navigate with user-friendly features such as multi-lingual options. Users will know the transparent foreign exchange rate before making a transaction and can choose to send funds directly to Dashen Bank accounts, wallet, cash-pick up and same-day delivery to other commercial bank accounts. According to Asfaw Alemu, Chief Executive Officer of Dashen Bank, “Our partnership with Ecobank enables us to reach out to the Ethiopian diaspora in Europe to provide them with a new, reliable, low-cost and convenient way to send money to their families and relatives back home in Ethiopia through the Rapidtransfer International app.”
