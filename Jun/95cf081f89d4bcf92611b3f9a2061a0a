The prestigious Multi­Choice Talent Factory (MTF) has announced the opening of applications for its world-class film and tele­vision training programme, for the class of 2024. MTF Academy is open to all emerging filmmakers with either some industry experience or a relevant post-school qualification in film to apply for the exciting opportunity to hone their television and film produc­tion skills. Application for the MTF programme is open till 14 July, 2023. Announcing the call to entry, MTF West-Africa Di­rector, Atinuke Babatunde, said the MTF curriculum has been designed to equip students with the skill set needed to tell unique Afri­can stories. “There are so many stories on our conti­nent that need to be told and documented with a sense of skill and passion, and that is what the MTF Academy curriculum has been de­signed for working with our facilitating partner; the Pan Atlantic University’s School of Media and Communica­tions. “The students will be given hands-on training in areas such as film di­recting, sound design, and the business of film, with workplace experience on Africa Magic and Super­Sport top productions,” Babatunde said. Students will also get enhanced training experi­ence from the Academy’s partnerships, including the New York Film Acad­emy (NYFA), the Henley Business School, Dolby, and Canon. Previous cohorts have also worked with the United Nations’ Verified campaign, and pitched proj­ects to Partners Against Pi­racy (PAP). Launched in 2018, the MTF Academy has honed the skills of over 120 emerg­ing filmmakers in 13 coun­tries across the continent. The MTF Alumni class of 2022, within three months of graduating, saw sixty percent of its graduates al­ready economically active in the television industry.
