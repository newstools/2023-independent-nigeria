Operatives of the Lagos Rapid Re­sponse Squad (RRS) have arrest­ed a dismissed policeman, Alobo Omokhoa, parading himself as an Inspector of Police in Ogudu GRA, Ojota Lagos. The suspect aged 48, was escorting a Golf Volkswagen, conveying stainless iron to a construction site in Ogudu GRA, Kosofe, when the operatives ar­rested him as he was about to flee the scene. While being interrogated by the Commander, Lagos Rapid Response Squad, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi, Alobo could not give satisfactory answers to prove that he was a serving member of the Force. Preliminary investigations revealed that he was dismissed from the Force in 2020 for de­sertion. Upon further investi­gation, it was discovered that since his dismissal, he had been in the criminal act of escort­ing cars and trucks conveying goods to any part of Lagos for a fee. Meanwhile, the Commission­er of Police, Lagos State Com­mand, CP Idowu Owohunwa, while commending the RRS for the achievement, warned those impersonating police officers in Lagos to reconsider their actions or be prepared for a tough time henceforth. A statement signed by SP Benjamin Hundeyin, the Police Public Relations Officer, Lagos State Command, further stated that the suspect would be charged to court at the conclusion of the investigation.
