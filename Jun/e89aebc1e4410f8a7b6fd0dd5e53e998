ANDREW UTULU The President and General Overseer of United Apostolic Church of Christ (UACC), Rev. Dr. James Bayo Owoyemi, has congratulated the new President of Nigeria, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and the Vice President, Kashim Shettima, describing their administration as a new dispensation begins in Nigeria. The cleric, however, called on the new government to put the Almighty God first in all they do and ensure that all Nigerians, irrespective of tribe and religion, are carried along. Owoyemi made this call in a statement signed by the UACC Media Director, Pastor Paul Erakhifu. Erakhifu said: “The UACC General Overseer, Rev. Owoyemi is wishing the new President success in governance. “He enjoined all Nigerians to support and pray for the 16th President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “Expectations of Nigerians are very high as the new government begins.” According to him, the new president should rule with a high level of fear of God by embracing fairness and eschewing nepotism in his administration. POLL Quoting John 3:27, he maintained, “Man cannot receive anything except it has been given from heaven.. “So, the new President should see his assumption of the highest office as Grace of God. “From our end, we will not relent in praying for our dear country. “We are optimistic that Tinubu’s government will bring succour to all the pains of Nigeria. “Once again, I, on behalf of United Apostolic Church of Christ wish the new President a successful administration.”
