ABUJA – The Initiative for Research, Innovation and Advocacy in Development and THE ELECTORAL HUB has called on members of the newly inaugurated 10th National Assembly to view their four-year tenure as an opportunity to impact positively on their constituents and contribute to the democratic advancement, development and prosperity of the country. Princess Hamman-Obels, the Director, IRIAD – The Electoral Hub, in a statement, noted that the National Assembly is not just another arm of the Nigerian government but an essential component for the service of public interests. According to Hamman-Obels, legislative functions of rule-making, budget approval, executive and judicial oversight, confirmation of appointments, and constitutional amendment, make it a key force for ensuring that government is not merely an exercise in the control of the people, but an exercise in the interest of the people. While congratulating the newly inaugurated National Assembly members whom IRIAD – THE ELECTORAL HUB described as being direct representatives of constituents, are the ideal agents for the expression of public will, the group stressed that the success of both the Senate and the House of Representatives in the effective discharge of their functions would be reflective of the broader success of the Federal and state institutions. “This can be best guaranteed through collective efforts from citizens, civil society actors, legislators themselves, as well as other arms of government.“For citizens, public inputs are crucial for ensuring responsiveness and accountability of elected representatives. We, therefore, urge every Nigerian to actively engage elected representatives through active participation in public forums, town hall meetings, and community discussions. These will allow citizens determine policy directions through demands, support and feedback. It will also enhance accountability as citizens will be better informed and equipped to monitor the assembly’s activities, track the performance of elected officials and demand transparency and accountability.“Civil society actors must leave no stone unturned in the continuous efforts towards securing a legislative arm that advances the ideals of responsiveness, responsibility, accountability, inclusivity and equitable management of state affairs.“The push for an active civic culture through sensitization campaigns, citizen-friendly legislation through advocacy, and stakeholder engagements, especially with members of the legislature are important activities that can guarantee that the 10th NASS upholds the tenets of democracy and good governance.We reiterate that the effectiveness and efficiency of the National Assembly is particularly dependent on the presence of open and effective channels of communication between citizens and their representatives.“We, therefore, implore members of the legislative arm to prioritize the needs of their constituents as they take up the roles and responsibilities they have signed up for. It is important that legislators establish channels of communication for inputs and feedback from their constituents and prioritize public interest in the discharge of their array of functions.“Established lines of communication would allow for meaningful and continuous dialogue between representatives and the populace. With meaningful dialogue and incorporation of the public will into legislative action, the Nigerian state can be better equipped to address the myriad of challenges she is currently confronted with.“Some of these specific issues of concern as compiled by IRIAD – The Electoral Hub in our engagement with indigenous people of the FCT in crafting an agenda for the 10th NASS include the need for representatives to: uphold justice and integrity, review housing policy in favour of the masses, obliterate sectional sentiments, sanction electoral offenders, ensure a fair judiciary, ensure adequate implementation of public policies, cut wastage of public funds, monitor project implementation to ensure quality, guarantee and protection of citizens’ rights, conformity with the rule of law, conduct a thorough public sector reform for improved education, health, transportation, and agriculture in the country. “These concerns are palpable and the extent to which the 10th NASS can address them would be very key to measuring their success or failure.“As an organization, we call on the 10th NASS to establish robust oversight committees to ensure accountability and legality of the actions of the other arms of government as well as government ministries, departments and agencies.“The National Assembly also needs to: strengthen extant accountability and anti-corruption laws and ensure their effective implementation, and contribute toward opening up government by ensuring effective and efficient implementation of the Freedom of Information Act.“There is also a pressing need for the 10th NASS to intensify efforts towards the quick passage of the Electoral Offense Commission Bill. This bill will not only enhance electoral integrity but also build public confidence in the electoral process. IRIAD – THE ELECTORAL HUB encourages the National Assembly and State House of Assemblies to work collaboratively across party lines and foster an environment of cooperation and consensus-building.“We are particular about gender and inclusivity issues and so we emphasize the need for the National Assembly and State House of Assemblies to promote inclusivity and gender equity in all aspects of governance. The legislature should work towards achieving equal representation and meaningful participation of women, youth, persons with disabilities, and marginalized groups in decision-making processes. We urge the assembly to pass legislation that addresses gender discrimination, gender-based violence, and promotes women’s rights and empowerment.“Representatives of the people need to act with integrity, transparency, accountability, and in the interest of the people. Policy measures are required to combat the tripartite problems of poverty, widening inequality and unemployment.“The 10th NASS can contribute to this end by introducing people-centred policies and reforms. Serving the people requires a genuine commitment to public service and a penchant for upholding the principles of democracy, inclusion, equity, and justice.“As an organization committed to promoting democratic values, promoting responsive and accountable governments, and advocating for inclusion, IRIAD-THE ELECTORAL HUB stands ready to support the 10th National Assembly in the interest of a better Nigeria.“We implore all elected representatives to recognize their 4-year tenure as an opportunity to impact positively on their constituents and contribute to the overall advancement of the quality of our democracy and development as a country” reads the statement in parts.
