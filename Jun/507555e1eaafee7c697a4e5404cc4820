ASABA – Hosts of the Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL) Su­per 6, Delta Queens yesterday qualified for the finals after holding rivals, Edo Queens to a goalless draw at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba Delta State. Having won their first game 3-1 against Confluence Queens, the home side needed to just avoid defeat against Edo who were condemned to win to boost qualification hopes, having suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Lokoja side, Confluence Queens. Edo Queens started the match the brighter of both sides, moving the ball crisply from side to side, while the home side looked to protect their goal and catch them on the break. The best chance of the game came in the 16th minute, as home Delta Queens defender Favour Damaris produced a last-ditch goal-line clearance to prevent the arriv­ing Moses Esther from scoring a tap-in at the back post. A flurry of chances oc­curred later in the first half but did not produce any spectacu­lar action as both sides went into the break with nothing to separate each other. The second half began as the first, with the away side showing more desire and hunger to get a result, but they were fortunate not to have fall­en behind in the 71st minute after some neat interplay be­tween Delta Queens attackers fashioned a good chance inside the opposition box, but some­how leading goalscorer Mercy Omokwo failed to hit the target from six yards.
