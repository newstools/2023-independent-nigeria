ASABA – The National Associa­tion of Private Schools (NAPS) in Oshimili South Local Govern­ment Area of Delta State has debunked claims that students and pupils were being initiated into cultism through a process called snake bite in schools with­in the locality. Flanked by other executive members of the association, the Chairman of the union in the locality, Mr. Samson Ekene, who spoke to pressmen in Asaba, maintained that the accusations about negligence by the private school were at variant with the reality as he branded the infor­mation as false. He stressed that the said foot­age has caused more damage than good to schools across the state, saying that if there was any truth to what was said, so­cial media is not the best place to send it. He urged parents to return their wards who have with­drawn their wards out of fear of the rumours, saying that many people feel private schools are only after the money but we do more than teach. He said the video was a mis­representation of information as he called on members of the public to disregard the video. According to him, the indi­vidual who posted it could have gone to the respective body under which the schools operate to lay a complaint. Since the incident, the police have been to the school to carry out their investigations. After their investigations, they con­firmed that bite marks were just the children playing and nothing related to cult initiation. “Let parents know and waive fears in their hearts because it is not an initiation. It is just a mere child’s play. We do not condone any form of moral decadence that can plague society. In pri­vate schools, we teach morals and we do not support cultism,” he stated.
