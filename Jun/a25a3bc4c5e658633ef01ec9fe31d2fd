LAGOS  – Nigeria must double its ex­ports capabilities in the drive to achieve external reserves target of $60 billion and an exchange rate of between N500 and N600, a policy document prepared for the President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s government shows. President Bola Tinubu has moved swiftly to reform the economy since being sworn into office on May 29, scrapping a costly petrol subsidy and curbs on the foreign currency market, which saw the official rate of the naira tumble to record lows. The report from Tinubu’s policy advisory council propos­es reforming the central bank, including a halt to its quasi-fis­cal operations that accelerated under suspended governor Godwin Emefiele. According to the report, about $50 billion to $60 billion in reserves and monthly inflows of up to $8 billion in export earn­ings and other capital inflows will be required to support the policy at an exchange rate of N500 to N600. This would be achieved by ramping up the production of oil and gas, lifting manufac­turing exports, and attracting investment in light electronics assembly, fertilizers, sugar, and palm oil. But Nigeria would need to more than double exports from $42.4 billion last year. Foreign re­serves, which have been falling, stood at $35.25 billion at the end of May, official data show. The revenue authority, cus­toms, and maritime agencies would be collapsed into a new single Nigerian Revenue Ser­vice to improve tax and revenue collection, the policy document shows. With more revenue, the gov­ernment can ramp up capital expenditure to 25 percent of gross domestic product from 4.1 percent and narrow the budget deficit to 3 percent of GDP, down from 4.78 percent estimated for this year, the document said.
