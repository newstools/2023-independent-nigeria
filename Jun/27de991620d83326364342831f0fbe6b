Former Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is on the radar of Leicester City, reports the Daily Mail. The Foxes got relegated to the Championship at the end of a disappointing 2022-23 campaign. They are without a manager and are keen on the former Red Devils boss. Solskjaer is not the only one Leicester are keeping tabs on, with Dean Smith, Scott Parker and Manchester City coach Enzo Maresca also on their radar. Man United parted ways with the Norwegian in November 2021 after a woeful start to 2021-22. The Red Devils hero was appointed by his old club in December 2018 on an interim basis. Solskjaer took over from Jose Mourinho for the rest of the 2018-19 season and was given the job permanently in March 2019 after 14 wins in 19 games. He signed a three-year contract to take over Man United permanently but could only lead them to a sixth-placed finish at the end of the season. POLL They finished third in 2019-20 and second in 2020-21, leading the club to hand him a new deal, but a slow start to 2021-22 cost Solskjaer his job. The Man United legend has been out of job since but could soon be on his way back to England. Taking the Leicester job will be a huge challenge as the club are set to lose most of their stars. The Foxes need a full squad rebuild and will hope to secure immediate promotion. Solskjaer has experience managing in the Championship having briefly been in charge of Cardiff City after they got relegated under him. He will fancy his chances of doing a good job at Leicester, but he is facing stiff competition from those with better C.Vs for the job. (SOURCE: Man Utd News)
