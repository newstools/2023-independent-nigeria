Inter have reportedly prepared a new offer for Raoul Bellanova but they’re not the only ones interested in the Cagliari owned right back. The 23-year-old Italian joined the Nerazzurri last summer on a €3m loan deal with a €7m buy option attached. He hardly featured across the season, seeing just 656 minutes of action across 22 total appearances. Despite this, Inter want to keep Bellanova, but they’re not willing to activate the €7m buy option. As such, they’ve set up a new meeting with Cagliari to discuss the terms of a new deal. As reported by TMW, Inter have prepared a new loan deal with a conditional obligation to buy clause attached for Bellanova, which’ll be confirmed in their meeting with Cagliari next week. The Nerazzurri aren’t alone in their interest, however, as a number of other clubs have emerged for the 23-year-old, including Torino. The ball is now in Bellanova’s court, and a decision will likely be made after the conclusion of the Under-21 European Championship.
