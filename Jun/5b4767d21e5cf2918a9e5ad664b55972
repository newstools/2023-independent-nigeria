LAGOS  – The Nigerian Mainstream and Downstream Petroleum Regula­tory Authority (NMDPRA) has urged Nigerians not to panic over the removal of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) subsidy. NMDPRA, in a press state­ment on Tuesday signed by Kim­chi Apollo, General Manager, Cor­porate Communications, read, “We wish to address concerns re­garding the announcement of the removal of subsidy on Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “Contrary to speculations and concerns, the announcement is in line with the Petroleum Indus­try Act (PIA 2021) which provides for total deregulation of the pe­troleum downstream sector to drive investment and growth. “We are working closely with NNPC Limited and other key stakeholders to guarantee a smooth transition, avoid any disruptions in supply as well as ensure that consumers are not short-changed in any form. “The authority assures that there is an ample supply of PMS to meet demand as we have taken necessary steps to ensure distri­bution channels remain unin­terrupted and the fact is readily available at all filling stations across the country. “We, therefore, call on all Nige­rians to remain calm and resist the urge to stockpile as it poses a significant safety hazard,” The NMDPRA reassures all Nigerians that the removal of subsidy on PMS is a step towards building a more sustainable and prosperous future for the nation. “We will continue to monitor activities and implement the necessary measures to enhance transparency and accountabili­ty in the petroleum downstream sector,” the statement added.
