Three people were killed in the central English city of Nottingham on Tuesday, police said, adding that they have detained an unnamed suspect. Police were called to a residential area just after 4 a.m. local time “where two people were found dead in the street,” they said in a statement. They said another male victim was found dead about two miles away. Officers also responded to a third incident close by “where a van had attempted to run over three people.” They are being treated in a hospital. Nottinghamshire police did not indicate a motive for the killings but said they had detained a 31-year-old man on “suspicion of murder.” “This is an horrific and tragic incident which has claimed the lives of three people,” Chief Constable Kate Meynell said in a statement. “We believe these three incidents are all linked and we have a man in custody.” She urged the public to be patient and said a number of roads in the city would remain closed. “This investigation is at its early stages and a team of detectives is working to establish exactly what has happened,” Meynell added.
