Former Senate President, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, has congratulated Muslims around the world on this year’s Eid-El-Kabir festival and urged them to continue to pray to Allah to intervene in the affairs of the country by restoring peace, unity, prosperity, security, and de­velopment across its nooks and cranny. In a Sallah message from his media office in Abuja signed by Yusuph Olaniyonu, Saraki noted the significance of the Eid-El-Kabir festival as it symbolises the test of the faith of Prophet Ibrahim who is the origin of the world’s big­gest religions and urged Mus­lims to borrow some of the attributes of the man known as the father of faith. “Prophet Ibrahim demon­strated unflinching faith in Al­mighty Allah and his creator compensated him by making him the father of the most prosperous nations today. He demonstrated patriotism by praying to Allah to bless his land and his forbears that will come from generations after him. Today, we can see the manifestation of Prophet Ibrahim’s prayers in the pros­perity of the lands occupied by his offspring. “It is for this reason that I use this occasion to call on Nigerians to also continue to pray for our country. We need to continue to request our creator to turn things around for the better in Nigeria. We need God to help us conquer our economic, political, social, and security challenges. “I also urge our country­men and women to demon­strate faith by ensuring that those who are privileged come to the aid of the less privileged ones and ensure that many people across the country can celebrate this Sallah in a joyous mood and with food in their households,” he stated. Saraki added that times are hard for many Nigerians be­cause of the general econom­ic situation and the resultant high cost of food items. He, therefore, pleaded with trad­ers to desist from adding to the suffering of their fellow citizens by unnecessarily raising the prices of goods in the market.
