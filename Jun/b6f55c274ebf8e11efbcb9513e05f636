ABUJA – The First Lady, Oluremi Tinubu, on Saturday at the Valedictory session of the 9th Senate of the National Assembly, disclosed that her husband, President Bola Tinubu, never wanted her to be a Senator. Senator Oluremi who was the third to speak after the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, and the current Vice President, Senator Kashim Shettima, had spoken, said that President Tinubu initially frowned at her desire to join the Red Chamber in 2011. The lawmaker who had been at the Senate for 12 years further revealed that after several persuasions, the former Lagos State governor eventually relented and gave her his support. Thanking colleagues for their support, She added “My thanks will go to my husband for even giving me support. He gives me advice when I seek it. He gave me the freedom to be myself and to be able to make contributions necessary to improve the lives of our people, especially our women, youths and children.” This is as she further explained that “God sustained me for three terms, from 7th Assembly to 9th Assembly. I am still confused about how I have been able to continue the journey because serving the nation takes a lot of sacrifices. It started with the sacrifice from your homes, your children, even your better half.” Sen. Tinubu commended the camaraderie atmosphere that existed among legislators, which she said has “over the years, we have made friends, brothers, sisters across our various tribes, ethnicity and religious divide. POLL “We have the entire Nigerians being represented and we were able to forge ahead and come together when we need to make very good decisions in the overall interest of the nation. We did that as elder statesmen and women. I did all that is required of every legislator. Motions, bills including those that had been assented to by law.”
