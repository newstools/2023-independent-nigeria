Governor Umo Eno of Akwa Ibom State, on Thursday, said his administration will work with President Bola Tinubu to secure as many benefits for the people of his state from the federal government. Eno who revealed this to State House Correspondents after he met President Tinubu at the Aso Rock Villa, Abuja, said his State needs federal intervention to develop its infrastructure. The new governor said though he is of the main opposition, Peoples Democratic Party, he cannot afford to work apart from the federal government. “Politics is over and governance has started,” he said.He explained that “There are lots of things we expect from the federal government and it’s only with that cooperation that we can work together and achieve the common good, whatever I know I can do, to bring the dividends of democracy to my people, I will do it.” Eno noted that he has so many plans for his people but cannot achieve them by working at variance with the President. “We came to visit with the President, to congratulate him on the election and his swearing-in and to pledge our support, our commitment, and our loyalty to the President and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “So, Akwa Ibom is an integral part of Nigeria and we have to work with the federal government to ensure that Akwa Ibomites will see the benefits of democracy and we cannot do that if we work standing apart.
