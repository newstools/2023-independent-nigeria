The Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, has denied knowledge of any conflict between the Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun and former governor, Otunba Gbenga Daniel. According to a statement signed by Chief Sola Ebiseni, Secretary General, Afenifere said the purported statement date June 27, 2023, in a newspaper publication, did not emanate from them adding that the office of the national organizing secretary as the last holder had been dismissed and his membership suspended. The statement read: “Further to your letter dated 27th June 2023 in respect of a publication in The Punch today on the alleged misunderstanding between Otunba Gbenga Daniel, former Governor of Ogun State and present Senator representing Ogun East Senatorial District and His Excellency, Dapo Abiodun, Governor of the State, please be informed that Afenifere is not aware of any such misunderstanding between the two eminent Yoruba personalities. “In the event of such occurrence, which is not unnatural, Afenifere has time-honoured Yoruba modus operandi for result-oriented intervention, part of which is not taking side or playing to the gallery. “The statement credited to the Afenifere was not made by the Organisation and we are utterly surprised that, by your position, you may not know that the office of the National Organising Secretary of Afenifere is vacant, the last holder thereof having been dismissed and his membership suspended as disciplinary measures for unauthorised and embarrassing public statements, which development the press is also not unaware of. “Besides, you may also wish to know that it is not part of the functions of the National Organising Secretary to speak for the Afenifere in public communications.”
