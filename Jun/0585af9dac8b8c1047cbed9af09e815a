Ariston Group,has presented its ESG vision and goals to 2030 within Road to 100, a strategic plan manifesto of the group’s commitment to sustainability. The thermal comfort industry is at the heart of the energy transition: buildings account for nearly one third of global final energy consumption and, more specifically in Europe, in the residential sector, 62.8% of the energy consumption stems from space heating and 15.1% from water heating. Within this scenario, Ariston Group, which operates in the industry exceeding 3 billion euros in revenue , plans its future by striving to fully integrate sustainability into its corporate strategy and defines a path of activities and initiatives aimed at achieving concrete yet ambitious sustainability targets. “As a company, we feel a strong responsibility to address the great challenges of our time head on. The 100th anniversary of Ariston Group occurs in conjunction with the terms of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and we look at this milestone as an opportunity to reaffirm the role we want to play in actively contributing to the sustainability of future economic, social and environmental ecosystems. “We work to create long-term value for our stakeholders, while committing every day to link our sustainable growth to the future of the Planet.” – said Paolo Merloni, Executive Chairman of Ariston Group.
