LOKOJA  – The management of De-Villa Hotel has called on the Police to intervene in the forceful takeover of its premises by the Union Homes and Savings Lim­ited. In the petition writ­ten to the Kaduna State Commissioner of Police through her Counsel, A.K. Usman and Co. dated 19th June, 2023 and made avail­able to journalists, alleged the armed occupation of property since 17th June, 2023 was masterminded by Nura Bello. According to the pe­titioner, De-Villa Guest House owns a five-storey building at Rafi Close, off Kachia Street, Kaduna, which it uses as a hotel, although it has three loan agreements with the Union Home and Limited Savings Limited in 2008, 2010 and 2012, respectively. “As a responsible cor­porate organisation, we don’t want to take the laws into our hands by doing anything whatso­ever which would lead to a breach of public peace within your domain, that is why we are calling for your urgent intervention for the bank to vacate the premises,” the petitioner stated.
