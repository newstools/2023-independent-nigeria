LOKOJA – Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bel­lo has approved 60 years as the retirement age for Law Officers in the employment of the State and no longer by the length of service. The Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Ibra­him Sanni Muhammed SAN disclosed this at a Two (2) – Day Training workshop for Law Of­ficers, from the Kogi State Office of the Public Defender and Citi­zens’ Commission, (PDCRC) and Ministry of Justice on Tuesday in Lokoja. The training was organized by Kogi PDCRC in Collaboration with Mercy Corps to scale up the capacity of PDCRC and Ministry of Justice, Law Officers on Alter­native Dispute Resolution and Mediation Skills. The Attorney General com­mended the Governor for gra­ciously approving the 60 years retirement age for Law Officers in compliance with Section 1(1) and (4) of the Kogi State Law Of­ficers (Harmonisation with Con­ditions of Service of Magistrates Etc) Edict, 1994. The Hon Attorney General stated that this is in response to Section 82(1)(a) of the Magistrate Courts Law of Kogi State, 2020, which His Excellency assented to in September 2020 and which amongst others provides “A magistrate shall cease to act as a magistrate where: he attains the age of Sixty (60) years”. According to the Attorney General, the approval by His Ex­cellency would ensure that the system benefits maximally from the skill and experience of such Law Officers in whom the state government has invested hugely by way of human resource devel­opment. Muhammed said that the new Magistrate Law and the approv­al of Sixty years retirement for Law Officers have further repo­sitioned the Justice Sector in the State to perform optimally with experience. “The Judiciary has com­menced the implementation of this law since 2020 in the deter­mination of retirement age for Magistrates in the State,” he said.
