In continuation of visita­tion to holy and historical places in Mecca, Saudi Ara­bia, which are associated with Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) during his lifetime, Ogun State Pilgrims have visited Mountains Nur, Toor, and Arafat, among others. The visitation, accord­ing to the Ad-hoc Commit­tee Chairman of the State Muslim Pilgrim Board, Dr. Tajudeen Ashaye, was to broaden pilgrims’ knowl­edge and awareness of the history and significance be­hind the important places. Dr. Ashaye noted that Mountain Nur known as Jabbal Nur was the place Prophet Muham­mad (S.A.W.) received the first revelations of the Holy Qur’an during the Month of Ramadan, while Mountain Toor or Jabbal Toor has the cave where Prophet Muhammad and Abubakr sought refuge for three days and nights from Quraysh before they left for Medinah. Addressing the pilgrims at Mount Arafat, Head of Operation of the Board, Imam Abdulfattah Buhari, said Arafat was a place of blessing, where Prophet Ibrahim wanted to sacri­fice his son, Ismail, before Allah mercifully replaced him with a ram for sacri­fice. He thereafter prayed for Allah’s mercy on the government and people of the state and the country at large. Speaking on behalf of the pilgrims, Alhaji Owola­bi Olanrewaju appreciated the board and officials for taking them through the process of visitation, promising to continue to abide by the rules and reg­ulations of the authority of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Recall that Ogun State Pilgrims had earlier visit­ed some historical places while in Medinah.
