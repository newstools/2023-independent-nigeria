BENIN  – The trustees and members of Benin Development Union (BeDU) have reacted to Esan traditional rulers’ visit to the Oba of Benin over Edo the 2024 governorship elec­tion, describing the visit as “something typifying hypoc­risy and an attempt to drag the revered Oba of Benin into the murky waters of partisan politics” This was contained in a statement signed by Dr. Orumwense Aiyudubie, Sec­retary General, Benin Devel­opment Union (BeDU). According to the state­ment, “We read with utter consternation, the ultimate objective of the royal visit by traditional rulers of Esan ex­traction to the Oba of Benin last week, as something typ­ifying hypocrisy. “They had sought to drag the revered Oba of Benin into the murky waters of partisan politics, apparently, with a view to reawaken the old feud between the Oba and the outgoing Governor. “Every student of our con­temporary history knows that since the return to democracy in 1999, no ethnic nationality has been deprived or outright excluded from seeking the gu­bernatorial primaries in our multiparty democracy. “So, why now? Since we announced the endorsement of the quadruplet nobles of Benin extraction for the gu­bernatorial race namely Osa­rodion Ogie Esq, Engr. Chris Osa Ogiemwonyi, Dr. Solo­mon Iyobosa Edebiri MON, and Mr. Erhabor Emokpae – we have been under intense pressure with huge financial offers to rescind our decision and back a candidate from another senatorial district, we rebuffed the offer as it is totally sacrilegious to probate and reprobate over such an overwhelming ethnic nation­ality resolve.
