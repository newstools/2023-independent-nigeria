DAHON, the global leader of folding bikes with more than 40 years in the industry, plans to extend its product range into a new category of motorcycles and Mopeds. Following the teaser showcased at the China International Cycle Fair in Shanghai on May 5-8, the brand plans to debut its three latest models, motorbike – Macaw, and electric mopeds – Magpie, and Tailorbird, at INABIKE, an executive tradeshow for the motorcycle industry in Indonesia. In such an exciting new direction, DAHON, in addition to existing E-bikes, strives to show that going green should not break the bank. The three latest (non–folding) quality models from its motorcycle and moped categories are available at a more attractive price point than many other models currently on the market, and they have zero CO2 emission, offering an ideal eco-friendly, cost-effective alternative to combustion engine-driven transportation. Focus dually on outdoor sport and fast urban mobility, Macaw sports a maximum range of 80km (50 miles) on a full charge, with a 100km/h top speed while consuming just 6.19kW/h of power. The 72V/73aH lithium-ion battery takes just 6 hours to reach full capacity, faster than most other electric motorcycles of a similar standard. The sporty and jazzy Macaw is powered by a 5000W motor and its speed can reach up to 120KM/H (75mph). It has a front and rear tire size of F: 110/70-17 R:140/70-16, and dimensions of L 715 (28″) x W 2060 (81″) x H 1140 (45″). POLL Both Magpie and Tailorbird mopeds boast a maximum range of 110km (56 miles) on a full charge, while only consuming 2.7kW/h of power. They can also be equipped with an optional 60v-72v /32Ah lead acid battery, which takes just 8 hours to reach full capacity. Powered by a 1000W motor, fashionable Magpie and Tailorbird can reach up to 60km/h (37mph), and are equipped with a high-efficiency controller. Magpie has a front and rear tire size of F:80/90-14 R:90/90-14, the dimensions of L 700 (27″) x W 1880 (74″) x H 1220 (48″).
