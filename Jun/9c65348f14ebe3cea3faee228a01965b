Bahrain expressed Sunday, June 25, 2023, its strong condemnation of the Israeli settlersâ€™ attacks in the West Bank, which resulted in Palestinian casualties and property destruction. In a statement, Bahrain affirmed its firm position calling for calming the situation, providing protection for civilians, and establishing an independent Palestinian state. Last night, Israeli settlers continued their attacks on the village of Umm Safa, northwest of Ramallah and its environs, and burned an electricity transformer, which led to cutting off electricity to the village and a number of neighboring towns. On June 22, Israeli settlers stormed the Al-Ribat Mosque in Orief village, in the occupied West Bank city of Nablus, and caused great damage to the mosque, tearing the holy book of the Quran and throwing them to the ground.
