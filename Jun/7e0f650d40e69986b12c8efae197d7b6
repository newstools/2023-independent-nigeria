The Delta State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has revealed how the former deputy president of the Senate and governor­ship candidate of the party in the state, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, worked against President Bola Ahmed Tinu­bu during the presidential election. The state chapter of the party urged the president to investigate and also order a restructure of the Delta State APC in preparation for the 2027 general elections. The party has also raised alarm over threats to lives of its state chairman, Hon Isaac Ulebor, state secretary, Inana Micheal, Dr. Cairo Ojougboh and other members of the state executive. Reacting to an adverto­rial of June 22, 2023 in one of the national dailies, the state chapter of the party, in a statement by its secretary, Inana Michael, Delta North Chairman, Engr. Tom Onah, Delta South Chairman, Nel­son Ogharamidiki and Delta Central Chairman, Michael Orunefe respectively, noted that Ojougboh was being cas­tigated because of his bold­ness to speak the truth. Quoting Plato to buttress the person of Ojougboh, the party executive said, “no one is more hated than he who speaks the truth.” They said: “We, therefore, understand the reason Omo- Agege’s desire is to roast Dr Cairo Ojougboh, who will al­ways speak the truth to power in whatever endeavour God bestows on him. “In our open letter to His Excellency President Ahmed Bola Tinubu, we asked Mr. President to invite the secu­rity agencies to investigate those issues we raised in and out. This was because we are sure of what we are saying. Meanwhile, in the paid advert newspaper response, Omo- Agege and his group could not summon the courage to address the issues raised.” Responding to four of the issues raised in the publica­tion, the state chapter of the party, led by Ulebor, insist­ed that Omo-Agege worked against the APC and Tinubu during the presidential elec­tion.
