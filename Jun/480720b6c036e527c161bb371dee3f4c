President Bola Tinu­bu has set up an in­ter-agency committee to sit from yesterday (Friday) to resolve the row over alleged unremitted funds between the Nigeria National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) and the Federation Account Allocation Commit­tee (FAAC) in the last couple of years. It was gathered from a reli­able source that “Mr. President has approved the memo from NNPC Limited to set up a com­mittee to reconcile the crisis between the Oil Company and FAAC over the failure to remit money into the federation ac­count.” The committee followed a June 13, 2023 memo by the Group Chief Executive Officer (GECO) NNPC Kyari request­ing President Tinubu’s inter­vention in the matter. The letter stated that this was with a view to putting to rest all the allegations and counter-allegations by both FAAC and NNPC Limited on the status of the debts and re­mittances. The committee, which will sit at the Ministry of Finance is mandated to reconcile the controversies surrounding the N4.2 trillion debt the Federal Government is owing NNPC Limited and the N2.1 trillion that the NNPC Limited is said to have failed to remit to the Federation Account. Other members of the debt reconciliation committee in­clude the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Federal Inland Rev­enue Service (FIRS), Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF), and FAAC Post-Mortem Sub-Committee. Findings showed that some vested interests had allegedly misinformed President Tinu­bu and this has prompted the national oil company to take the step to lay the issue to rest. “The President was mis­informed about the payment to the federation accounts, and he has approved that an inter-agency committee is constituted to investigate and reconcile the matter,” noted the source POLL FAAC had severally ac­cused the NNPC Limited of short-changing it by refusing to pay over N2 trillion generat­ed from crude sales, royalties, and taxes into the federation ac­count while the NNPC Limited on the other hand had said that the Federal Government was indebted to it to the tune of over N4 trillion in subsidy payment, power debt and other sundry charges.
