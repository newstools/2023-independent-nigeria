The ongoing hearing of a petition by the former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar against the election of President Bola Tinubu was abruptly adjourned on Tuesday by the Presidential Election Petition Court sitting in Abuja, due to the alleged refusal of the Independent National Electoral Commission to make release some critical electoral materials available to the petitioner. Eyitayo Jegede SAN, who conducted Tuesday’s proceeding on behalf of Atiku’s legal team told the PEPC that Atiku had paid as much as N6m for the supply of certified true copies of the exhibits. However, he lamented that the electoral body had not been forthcoming and cooperating as required and envisaged. Meanwhile, the PEPC has adjourned further hearing in the petition till June 7, for INEC to respond to the request of Atiku and the Peoples Democratic Party PDP for the supply of the documents.
