Kebbi State Caretakers Committee Chairman of Kebbi State Police Community Relations Committee, Comrade Shehu Umar has called on the officers and men of the Kebbi state police command to maintain a frank, cordial and mutual relationship with his committee members. He gave the charge at their maiden meeting held in Birnin Kebbi to set up preparations for elections of substantive members of the committee who would pilot the affairs of the committee. Shehu lamented that a registered member of the PCRC cannot secure bail of a suspect from the police despite efforts put in place by them to assist the police in crimes fighting in the state “while we work towards sensitizing people on the need for them to join PCRC our inability to get a bail from the police is discouraging he said the police should be seen romancing with PCRC not the other way round “. Contributors at the meeting decried lack of publicity of PCRC also urged the care takers to ensure people in Kebbi are aware of it’s existence in the state. Speaking further, Comrade Shehu tasked members on registrations as only duly registered members can vote and be voted for, adding that the elections would be conducted by the National officers therefore unregistered members would not even be allowed into the elections hall as only those with identity card of PCRC are eligible voters. He called on Kebbi state government to provide office accommodation for PCRC in order to operate maximally.
