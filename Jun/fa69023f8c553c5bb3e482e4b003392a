Italian journalist Rudy Galetti has reported on Twitter that Aston Villa are in the race for Leicester City attacking midfielder James Maddison. Newcastle United are in talks with Leicester over a potential move for the England international playmaker, according to the reporter. Galetti has added that Tottenham Hotspur are also keen on the 26-year-old Englishman. The journalist wrote on Twitter (11:56am, June 9, 2023): “#Maddison, #Newcastle are still in talks with #Leicester for the MD and they’re working for him since Jan. “Also #Tottenham – that may decide to take some concrete steps soon – and #AstonVilla in the race. “After relegation to Championship, James wants to leave.” In our view, Aston Villa could find it tough to sign James Maddison from Leicester City ahead of Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United. Yes, Villa are a big and established club in the Premier League who are going places under former Arsenal manager Unai Emery. POLL However, Tottenham are a massive club who regularly challenge for the Premier League top four. And Newcastle will play in the UEFA Champions League next season and have grand plans under Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) for the future. We believe that Maddison would pick Newcastle or Tottenham over Villa, although it remains to be seen which club are willing to offer more transfer fees for the playmaker, described as as “an incredible player” by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola in The Manchester Evening News in June 2019.
