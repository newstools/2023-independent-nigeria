Gunmen have killed a 53-year-old man named Isaac Odeh and abducted his 23-year-old son, Solomon Odeh, in Ijagba community, Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State. The incident reportedly happened while the victims were on their way to their farm within the community. The kidnappers were said to have collected a ransom of N400,000 for the release of the victims but still killed Isaac. A Chief in the community, Sunday Ogoh, lamented the continuous attacks on farmers and locals in the community, which he alleged were being perpetrated by herdsmen. Ogoh also disclosed that the community has lost a former chairman, Bola Adelegbe to the activities of the suspected herders. He added that Odeh’s lifeless body was found in the bush after a long period of search, and his remains were deposited in the mortuary. “It is now imperative, due to the ugly incident, to cry out and seek the support of the government and all relevant authorities to protect our lives and properties, which is one of the aims of the government since we can no longer go to the farm or sleep with our two eyes closed. “This problem is not only limited to Ijagba; these Fulani herdsmen do operate in Imoru, Molege, Arimagija, Ute, and Okeluse. There is no security in those areas,” he said. POLL Solomon, the son of the deceased, recounted how he and his father were tied up with rope by the suspected herdsmen. According to him, the kidnappers threatened to kill both of them if their relatives failed to pay the ransom. “Unfortunately, they carried out their threat and killed my father, even after a ransom of N400,000 was paid,” he lamented. Meanwhile, the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, in the state, Funmilayo Odunlami-Omisanya, who confirmed the incident, assured the public that the police were actively working to apprehend those responsible for the attacks.
