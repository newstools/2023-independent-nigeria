Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says his country is ready to launch its much-anticipated counteroffensive to liberate territory occupied by Russian forces while warning that it could take some time and be costly. “We strongly believe that we will succeed,” Zelenskiy said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published on June 3. “I don’t know how long it will take. To be honest, it can go a variety of ways, completely different. But we are going to do it, and we are ready,” he added. Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian Army had not received “all the weapons it hoped for, but we can’t wait any longer.” Zelenskiy said last month his country needed more weaponry, including armored vehicles, before it could launch its long-awaited counteroffensive. The Ukrainian president has been pushing for more military aid and weapons from Western countries. Russia has captured Ukrainian territory in the east, south, and southeast. Zelenskiy said Ukraine urgently needed more U.S.- made Patriot missile-defense systems to protect its citizens from Russian air strikes and to shield troops fighting on the front lines. He said a lack of protection from Russian aerial attacks means “a large number of soldiers will die” in the counteroffensive. POLL Separately, Deputy Defense Minister Volodymyr Havrylov told Reuters on June 3 that the goal of an “unprecedented” wave of Russian missile and drone attacks across the country in recent weeks was to stop the counteroffensive. Speaking on the sidelines of a top security conference in Singapore, Havrylov called Russia’s heavy use of ballistic missiles in May a “last strategic resort” and said that his country’s air-defense systems had been “more than 90 percent effective” against the attacks.
