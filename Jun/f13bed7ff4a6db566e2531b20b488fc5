The National Universities Commission(NUC) has granted approval to Chrisland University, Abeokuta, to commence offering academic programmes in International Relations and Diplomacy. Following this development, the University has begun spirited moves to commence the admission process for prospective students for the next academic session. This was disclosed to newsmen by the Head of the Department of International Relations and Diplomacy in the institution, Dr Kunle Olawunmi, a retired Naval Commodore and Associate Professor of Global Counter-Terrorism. According to him, the development was a fallout of a recent accreditation granted by the NUC to that effect. Dr Olawunmi enjoined interested candidates who were successful in the recently released JAMB-UTME to forward their applications to the University for consideration for International Relations and Diplomacy. Dr Olawunmi commended the Universityâ€™s Vice-Chancellor, Prof Chinedum Peace Babalola for her great strides in making Chrisland University one of the best in the country through intellectual radiance.
