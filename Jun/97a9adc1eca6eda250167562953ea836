IBADAN – The Lead Bishop of Worldwide Anglican Church (WAC) in Ni­geria, Rt. Rev. Seun Adeoye, has congratulated the newly appointed acting Inspector General of Police, Mr. Kayode Egbetokun. Adeoye in a statement in Osogbo, Osun State on Wednesday, described Eg­betokun’s appointment as a right peg in a round hole, going by his profiles. However, the spokesman of World Bishops’ Council (WBC) in Africa urged him to come out with effective plans on how to tackle the nation’s insecurity headlong. The cleric called on him to see that men of the Nigerian Police embrace profession­alism by coming out with modern policing models that will easily detect criminal el­ements within the system. “Rampant reports of some bad policemen way­laying and robbing youths of their monies at gunpoint is worrisome. These bad el­ements must be identified, punished and if necessary pushed out of the service. “The nation’s security needs new and radical ap­proaches. And Nigerians are hopeful when you said you are coming as a tiger to chase criminals and as a lion to devour them”. The cleric, who is also the General Overseer of Sufficient Grace and Truth Ministries, Rehoboth Arena, Okinni, Osun State, said Ni­gerians need reassurance that they could confidently trust the police. “There is undoubtedly se­rious security challenges in our nation. As at today, kid­nappings, banditries, com­munal clashes and so many other crimes are ravaging the land, you need to lead and mobilize your men to fight these monsters to standstill. POLL “Your anti-corruption tendency must come to bare. As the IGP, don’t be an arm­chair boss but be on the field with your men routing and clearing the jungles and the dark spots of criminals. Let troublemakers know that a new Sheriff is in town”. Bishop Adeoye urged the citizens to support the new IGP, saying considering his untainted background, Nigerians would definitely witness a more secured en­vironment.
