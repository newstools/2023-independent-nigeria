A release by the Director of Communications of the Think Tank, Mr Collins Steve Ugwu, said “the Executive Commit­tee of Aka Ikenga, led by our leader, Agbalanze Chike Madueke, appreci­ate the integrity process that saw his attaining this height in public service on account of exemplary profession­alism and commitment to duty. “We are happy not just because it happened deservedly, but moreso, for the critical implications of his as­signed duty as the supervising officer for South East policing on security, law and order. The grave challenges of insecurities to lives and businesses in your area of primary supervision, the South East, is one that will surely put you to test, to put them at rest, we clearly point out. “As you down to the burden of this responsibility, we charge you to draw deeply from your extensive competences that mark your eleva­tion, an urgent call for more work. We are confident that with your ser­vice resume and career traction, your knowledge of the environment will stand you firm to bring the invasive criminal mutations in the South East, with vicious disruptions to their social and economic activities to a decisive end. We emphasize that at no time than now, does this region, famed for commerce and industry, deserve secured peace to focus on the challenges of development and livelihoods in their homeland. “We draw your attention too to the dimensions of multiple checkpoints curiously peculiar to that region, and hope that a definite reset by extant service discipline, will leverage it for better security, than unedifying resentments for opportunism. “We believe the tireless synergy between you and an Inspector Gener­al of Police with the zeal of a lion will restore safety in our homestead, and assure you our collaborative supports to make it happen with other perti­nent stakeholders, because South East should come back as the region of reference in security for low crim­inality index.
