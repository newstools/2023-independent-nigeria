Prominent Igbo Global Think Tank, Aka Ikenga, has extended commendation to the recently promoted Deputy Inspector General of Police, DIG Frank Mba over his current elevation and assignment. In a release by the Director of Communications of the Think Tank, Mr Collins Steve Ugwu, he said, the Executive Committee of Aka Ikenga led by our President, Agbalanze Chike Madueke appreciate the integrity process that saw his attaining this height in public service on account of exemplary professionalism and commitment to duty. We are happy not just because it happened deservedly, but more so, for the critical implications of his assigned duty as the supervising officer for South East policing on security, law, and order. The grave challenges of insecurities to lives and businesses in your area of primary supervision, the South East, is one that will surely put you to the test, to put them at rest, we clearly point out. As you settle down to the burden of this responsibility, we charge you to draw deeply from your extensive competencies that mark your elevation, an urgent call for more work. We are confident that with your service resume and career traction, your knowledge of the environment will stand you firm to bring the invasive criminal mutations in the South East, with vicious disruptions to their social and economic activities to a decisive end. We emphasize that at no time than now, does this region famed for commerce and industry, deserve secured peace to focus on the challenges of development and livelihoods in their homeland. We draw your attention too, to the dimensions of multiple checkpoints curiously peculiar to that region, and hope that a definite reset by extant service discipline will leverage it for better security, than unedifying resentments for opportunism. We believe the tireless synergy between you and an Inspector General of Police with the zeal of a lion will restore safety in our homestead, and assure you of our collaborative support to make it happen with other pertinent stakeholders because Southeast should come back as the region of reference in security for low criminality.
