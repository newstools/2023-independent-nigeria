Concerned Civil Society Advocacy Group has ques­tioned the House of Repre­sentatives Committee on Aviation for describing the recently unveiled national carrier, Nigeria Air project a fraud. The House Committee had called the project a fraud after what it called a hastily organised ‘public hearing’ whose outcome was obvi­ously predetermined. The immediate past Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, alongside the Man­aging Director of Ethiopian Airlines, crew members of Nigeria Air and other stake­holders in the industry had unveiled the national car­rier, Nigeria Air, with the target to generate $1 billion revenue within five years. The aircraft, a Boeing 737- 800 series, has a 180-passen­ger capacity. Some aviation analysts have criticised the flag-off. But a write up by the group titled “Nigeria Air: Giving the Dog a Bad Name in Order to Hang it ” …said the House Committee state­ment was a deliberate mis­information by opponents of the Nigerian Air project who have been masquerad­ing their real intentions as national interest. The statement signed by the group’s National Coor­dinator, Bako Barkindo and National Secretary Julius Adaji, stated; “We conclude that all the negatives being spread about the Nigeria Air project is only to ‘give a dog a bad name so they can hang it. “We, therefore, appeal to the government of Presi­dent Bola Ahmed Tinubu to ensure the take-off of the airline which, as we are aware, was at that stage be­fore the legal hurdle placed in its way.” POLL It listed some of the bene­fits of the national carrier as competitive ticket prices, di­rect flights to international destinations, national pride etc.
