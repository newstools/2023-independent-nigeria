IBADAN  – The Otun Olubadan of Ibadan­land, High Chief Rasidi Ade­wolu Ladoja has given the hint that he may not be part of the eleven (11) Ibadan High Chiefs recently elevated to become beaded crown Obas by Gover­nor Seyi Makinde. It could be recalled that the Oyo State Governor had signed into law the State Chieftaincy system bill as amended by the Oyo State Legislature which gives the governor the sole pow­er to decide who becomes what in Oyo traditional council. As the State government picked 7th July 2023 as the cor­onation day, a source very close to the former governor, Sena­tor Rasidi Ladoja, who pleaded anonymity hinted on Friday that, the Otun Olubadan will distance himself from the cor­onation of the High Chiefs as beaded crown Obas. “Baba is presently in Coto­nou. He has not made his posi­tion known on this new devel­opment but I can tell you he will not be part of this comedy. “The last time I spoke with him about it. What he said was that he did not set out to become a lesser Oba when he began the journey. His dream is to become the Olubadan and nothing less,” the source sub­mitted.
