The West African Examination Council (WAEC) which was subpoenaed by the Lagos State Governorship Election Tribunal to tender under oath, the certificate of Mr. Babajide Olusola Sanwoolu, has told the court through its representative that the council doesn’t retain a copy of certificates of candidates and so is unable to tender Mr. Sanwo-Olu’s certificate. While being cross-examined by counsels, the witness was asked if WAEC has records of all the candidates that wrote his examination, and he answered in the affirmative. When asked, in case of loss of certificate, how a candidate of WAEC can retrieve his/her lost certificate, the witness said by approaching WAEC with evidence, or an attestation letter. He was also asked why he didn’t bring up the said attestation for Mr. Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, but he had no answer to give. Recall that the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Dr. Abdul-Azeez Olajide Adediran, popularly called Jandor had earlier challenged the integrity of the sudden upload of the 1981 WAEC result after it had been revealed on the portal to be a fake. Unfortunately, the names on the new result uploaded were different from what was on the Ijebu Ife community Grammar school statement of results Sanwo-Olu submitted for the 2019 election elections. On further interrogation, the counsel asked the WAEC witness if a discrepancy in names could suggest that such results do not belong to the same person, and he said “Most likely”. Meanwhile, the tribunal has issued another subpoena to WAEC to submit its result verification back-end server and other information technology infrastructure for forensic analysis in the presence of the court and all parties. POLL The case has been adjourned till 4th July 2023.
