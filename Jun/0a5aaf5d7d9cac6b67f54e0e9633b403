Alexis Mac Allister is set to undergo a medical with Liverpool on Tuesday, 90min understands, as the Reds look to finalise his transfer in the coming days. A long-term contract has been agreed with Mac Allister, whose deal with Brighton is understood to include a clause which Liverpool will activate to push this move closer to completion. Liverpool have acted quickly to secure the signature of Mac Allister, who is seen as an integral part of a midfield rebuild at Anfield, and sources have confirmed to 90min that the 24-year-old is due to undergo a medical on Tuesday. Mac Allister is due to depart for international duty later this week and so everyone involved is keen to get the deal over the line beforehand. All the signs suggest Liverpool will get their wish. With the signing of Mac Allister close to completion, Liverpool will switch their attention to further midfield reinforcements. The Reds are in the race to sign Chelsea’s Mason Mount, who will be sold this summer if an agreement over a contract extension is not reached soon, but face competition from Manchester United and Arsenal. As 90min revealed late last month, talks have been held with the representatives of both Borussia Monchengladbach’s Manu Kone and Nice’s Khephren Thuram, who have also attracted interest from most of Europe’s elite. Bayern Munich’s Ryan Gravenberch, Wolves’ Ruben Neves and impending free agent Youri Tielemans are all admired at Anfield, while Liverpool have also discussed a possible move for Leeds’ Tyler Adams following the Yorkshire outfit’s relegation from the Premier League.
