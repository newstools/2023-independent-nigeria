IBADAN – It has come to the knowl­edge of the Oyo State gov­ernment that a fake new salary structure is being circulated on social media. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to Gov­ernor Seyi Makinde, Sulaimon Olanrewaju, on Wednesday stated that although the govern­ment is working on reviewing the current salary structure, the committee set up for that purpose was yet to turn in its report. “Therefore, the salary struc­ture being circulated could not have emanated from the state government. It should thus be disregarded in its entirety,” the state noted. Recall that sequel to the re­moval of subsidy on Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), the state government set up a committee comprising leaders of the Nige­ria Labour Congress (NLC), the Trade Union Congress (TUC), as well as some government officials to come up with a new salary structure that would reflect the new realities in the country. The committee was given eight weeks to report back to the state government. As a way of cushioning the effect of subsidy removal on Oyo State residents as a whole, the governor, Makinde, direct­ed the deployment of more Omituntun buses to ease the transportation worries of the residents. He also directed that there should be no increase in the fare paid on these buses, while school children and senior citi­zens are to pay half-price. The state government is still considering further ways of easing the burdens.)
