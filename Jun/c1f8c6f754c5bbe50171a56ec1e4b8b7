JOS  – Plateau House of As­sembly Lawmakers on Thursday Pass Vote of No Confi­dence on Bartholomew On­yeka, the state Commission­er of Police over the sealing of the existing 17 Local Gov­ernment Area (LGA) Secre­tariats in the state. The State Assembly called for the immediate re-opening of the 17 LGA secretariats. Members of the Plateau 10th Assembly while ad­dressing newsmen at the complex through its spokes­man Hon. Ishaku Maren on Thursday accused the com­missioner of allegedly mis­leading the Inspector Gen­eral of Police (IGP) on the true situation in the state because of his political in­terest and involvement. The lawmakers spokes­man maintained that the police were supposed to protect lives and properties of citizens and to give prop­er protection of constituted authorities within the state, but what they enjoyed in the state was reversal, in which the police instead of being neutral, proved otherwise. He wondered why this same Commissioner of Po­lice refused to enforce orders in the state when immediate speaker Ayuba Abok was re­instated by the court and as well as former Chairman of Langtang North LGA Josh­ua Laven that was denied reinstatement after winning his case at Jos high court and court of appeal. He added that the sus­pended local government chairmen remained sus­pended over their failure to make available their local governments income and expenditure reports to the state assembly.
