NNEWI – In its effort to support the Anambra State government security initiative, the Nnobi Community in Idemili South Local Government Area of the state has launched its own vigilance group to tackle hoodlums in the area. The group which goes by the name Nnobi Central Vigilante Anambra Vigilance Group (Nnobi Central AVG) is headed by Commander Ojukwu Barth. Speaking during the unveiling of the vigilance group on Saturday, the President -General of Nnobi Welfare Organization (NWO), Okpala Dominic Savio said the Nnobi Vigilance Group was formed out of the need to support the Anambra State Government combat insecurity in Nnobi town. Okpala who said the event marked a new beginning in security management of Nnobi, lamented that the community had suffered from social vices ranging from kidnapping ,armed robbery, assassinations, killing for organ harvesting among others. “In the past few years, especially between the year 2019 and today, the Nnobi Community has been in the news for the wrong reasons, security wise. The entire stretch of Nnobi community was completely overtaken by all sorts violent criminalities ranging from kidnapping ,armed robbery, car snatching in broad daylight, assassinations, killing for organ harvesting among others “On almost weekly basis corpses of human beings gruesomely murdered elsewhere in cold blood were wantonly and recklessly dumped on Nnobi soil as a human abattoir without let or hindrance”. “In a metaphorical sense, Nnobi Community became the anatomical bed on which all forms of dastardly acts and criminality were hatched, nurtured and clinically executed without the slightest resistance and the safest ,tested and trusted transit route and hideout, for the escape and harbouring of criminals from other jurisdictions”, Okpala said.
