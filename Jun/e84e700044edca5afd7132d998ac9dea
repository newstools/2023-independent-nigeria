As part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) commitment and to further exemplify its commitment to the promotion of literacy, bolstering reading culture, and improving quality education among children aged 6-12, Leadway Group has launched an innovative extra-curricular initiative campaign tagged “Pages to Places” in 12 public schools across six states in Nigeria, namely, Lagos, Ogun, Abuja, Kaduna, Enugu, and Port Harcourt. The “Pages to Places” initiative, targeted at children, is a book reading initiative across select public primary schools with a vision to steer the young generation towards expanding the reading culture, broadening their healthy imaginative abilities, believing in a better world and becoming better, more creative, and more promising individuals. The “Pages to Places” initiative, which is under the group’s education-focused corporate social responsibility drive, Leadway Goes to School, has been designed to commemorate the 2023 Children’s Day celebration and is scheduled to run from Tuesday, May 30 to Wednesday, June 7, 2023. Speaking on the initiative, Mr. Olusakin Labeodan, the Group Chief Marketing Officer of Leadway Holdings, cited that according to the World Culture Score Index, Nigeria has one of the world’s lowest reading cultures. At the same time, available statistics from the National Commission for Mass Literacy, Adult and Non-Formal Education show that 38 percent of Nigerians are illiterate, with four out of every ten primary school children being illiterate. “We believe in the transformative power of a book, its potential to improve the intellectual capacity of our young ones, and its capacity to shape the future into a promising horizon no matter one’s social-economic background.
