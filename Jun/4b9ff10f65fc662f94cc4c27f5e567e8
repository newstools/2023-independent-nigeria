The Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) begins a two-day All Comers and Golden League trials at the Samuel Ogbemudia stadium in Benin, with the female 100 meters opening the heat. As the sprinters burn the tartan tracks at the remodelled Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, the field is busy with a javelin, Discuss, shortcut and long jump among other activities of field events. According to the AFN programme, the golden league meets take center stage tomorrow to climax the two-day track and field events in Benin. The two-day trials, according to an AFN official will be moved to Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital for the continuation of the Golden League and later return to Benin again for the grand finale at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in July this year. The All Comers and Golden League Trials are designed for the qualifications to the World Athletics Championship slated for August 19-27 this year in Budapest, Hungary. The remodelled Samuel Ogbemudia stadium which also hosted the Federation of International Sports Union (FISU) two months ago for its trials in preparation for the world University Games slated for China later this year, and Nigeria Women Basketball League Qualifiers two weeks ago is now the destination for national sports events.
