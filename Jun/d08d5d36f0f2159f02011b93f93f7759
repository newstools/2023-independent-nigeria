LAGOS – Ambassador Victor Asije, International Society of Diplomats (ISD) Special Emissary on Media to Nigeria, has said that the United Nations (UN) Observance Days urgently required more follow-up actions globally to achieve their desired objectives. Asije disclosed this in a statement made available to newsmen in Lagos on Sunday, saying that the UN Days, with the emerging national and global challenges, needed less parties, speeches, branded T-shirts, caps, jeans, hugs, group pictures, backslapping and exchange of contracts. According to Asije, national governments, international organisations, communities, private organisations, non-governmental organisations, the media, among others, must know that the essence of these special days are beyond just these international dates. “These Observance Days, which the UN observes globally on certain days, weeks and years, are meant to promote awareness and action to match strides with emerging environmental and other national and global challenges. “But more prominence has over the decades been given to awareness creation than an all-out follow-up actions to make our silo-bunkered speeches, suggestions, recommendations and expertise yield the desired results. “We need to reduce to the barest minimum the huge amount of money we budget and spend on renting attractive hotels, halls, preparing banners, T-shirts, caps, jeans, snacks and drinks,” he said. The Ambassador observed that there was usually a disconnect and inaction between the Observance Days in one year and the next, a situation he described as “sleeping on duty”. Asije said that during the gap between the celebration of a day in a year and the next, challenges that were supposed to have been reduced have always increased.
