The co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), one of the world’s most prominent private investors in the global healthcare system, Bill Gates, is set to visit Nigeria. His visit is hinged on discussion on issues around health and development in the country and the continent of Africa. In a statement issued weekend by the BMGF media team, Mr Gates will be in Niger and Nigeria next week. Mr Gates’ visit to the two African nations is said to be a follow-up to his earlier visit to China and aimed at “discussing global health and development with national and local leaders, foundation partners, grantees, scientists, and young innovators.” The statement also noted that the visit is part of the Foundation’s commitment “to work closely with communities and leaders to support innovation that can help accelerate progress and improve lives across Africa.” The statement added: “Gates and other foundation leaders are visiting to learn from partners helping to address polio, anaemia, and other health threats; scientists applying research to develop agricultural innovations that will help with food security and climate adaptation; innovators using technology to improve access to financial services; and others working to improve lives in Niger and Nigeria and throughout the continent
