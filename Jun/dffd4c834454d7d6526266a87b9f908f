Jose Mourinho has reportedly contacted Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti to try and convince him of a move to Roma this summer. On Tuesday this week, Radio Roma reported that Roma have contacted the Ligue 1 giants to start exploring a move for the 30-year-old Italian midfielder, who seems to be on the way out of the French capital. Verratti saw almost 3000 minutes of action across 38 total appearances for PSG this season but has started to have doubts about his future with the club, leading him to consider a possible return to Italy. As reported by Corriere della Sera, Mourinho personally called Verratti to discuss the idea of moving to Roma in the coming months, keen to convince the talented midfielder. The Giallorossi’s interest is helped by their strong relationship with PSG, but the main problem now appears to be the 30-year-old’s high wages. The formula of the deal would likely be a loan with a buy option attached.
