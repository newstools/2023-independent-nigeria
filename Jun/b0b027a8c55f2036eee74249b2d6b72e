LAGOS  – As part of efforts to rid garages, parks, roadsides in Lagos from illegal liquor sales and consumption by motorists and drivers, the Lagos Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) popularly known as KAI embarked on raids last week which resulted in seizures of liquor drinks worth N2 million in Lagos. Corps Marshal of the agency, Gbemisola Akinpelu, a retired Commissioner of Police, disclosed that the raids will be a continuous exercise due to the displeasure expressed by the state Government at the alarming rate liquor drinks are sold in garages, motor parks, roadsides and in traffic. Akinpelu further revealed that the negative trend poses grave danger to the psychological, mental and general well-being of drivers, motorists and pedestrians alike. She highlighted that the confiscated liquor drinks will be handed over to the appropriate authorities for destruction, adding that the exercise will be witnessed by the agency and journalists. Akinpelu finally read the riot act to street traders to desist from displaying liquor drinks for sale in garages, motor parks, roadsides and in traffic, warning that the agency will not relent in its drive to rid the State of environmental nuisances.
