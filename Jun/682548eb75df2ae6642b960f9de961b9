The Bayelsa State government has said that no project embarked upon by the administration of Governor Douye Diri has been stalled as a result of funding problems. The Commissioner for Information, Orientation and Strategy, Ayibaina Duba, stated this at the transparency briefing for the months of February and March 2023 held in Yenagoa on Thursday. Duba said that in spite of the drop in federal allocation and internally generated revenue, the state government was working to complete all its ongoing projects. According to him, the Diri administration is responsible and responsive to its obligations to the people and development of the state. Duba said, “Whatever we do as a government we are committed to all that we are doing. “As you can realise there is no project that is going on, and I say this with every sense of responsibility, that has ever been stalled as a result of the lack of commitment on the part of government to go ahead with it. “We make bold to continually tell Bayelsans that no project, no matter the cost implications involved, will be stalled as a result of funding issue despite the fact that, as we know, the returns from the Federation Account and even the internally generated revenue are dwindling everyday. “Bayelsa State is not excluded from it but as a responsible and responsive government, we will continue to meet up all our obligations that we have decided to embark on.”
