Three-time Olympic medallist Tori Bowie died from complications related to childbirth, her agent has confirmed. Bowie died at the age of 32 at her Florida home in early May and her representative Kimberly Holland has spoken to American television in an attempt to put an end to speculation. “Unfortunately, so many people, including the media, are making speculations that she did something to herself, which is very hurtful,” Holland told CBS News after confirming Bowie was in labour at the time of her death. “So hopefully, now knowing the truth, there will be many apologies.” Bowie won 4x100m relay gold, 100m silver and 200m bronze for USA at the 2016 Rio Olympics, and the following year claimed individual 100m gold at the World Championships in London.
