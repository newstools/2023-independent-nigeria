Three minors were on Friday arraigned in an Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court for allegedly killing a peacock. The defendants, whose addresses were not disclosed, were charged with malicious damage. The Prosecution Counsel, Insp Olubu Apata, told the court that the defendants committed the offence on June 11 in Usi-Ekiti. Apata alleged that the defendants killed a peacock worth N1 million belonging to one Agbetuyi with the intent to steal it. He said the offence contravened the provisions of Sections 421 and 306 of the Criminal Laws of Ekiti State, 2021. The prosecutor prayed to the court for an adjournment to enable him to study the case file and present his witnesses. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. Counsel to the defendants, Mr Eric Omotoso, urged the court to grant them bail. POLL The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Kehinde Awosika, admitted them to bail in the sum of N50,000 each with one surety each in like sum. She adjourned the case until July 17 for a hearing. (NAN
