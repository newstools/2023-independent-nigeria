IBADAN – Olowu of Kuta, HRH Oba Adekunle Oyelude Makama, Tegbosun III, has warned former Niger Delta agitator, Mujahid Asari Dokubo not to demoralise the military with unguarded statement. Olowu in a statement issued by his media office said any attempt to Ridicule Nigerian Military because of few bad elements like any other institutions will be counter productive. The monarch said it takes a lot of efforts to build a country military to such standard that we have in Nigeria, adding that such sweeping statement that the military is responsible for the oil theft in Niger Delta is not the best. Olowu, who frowns at such generalisation said in as much as the country appreciates the support of Dokubo in the last few months to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, his outburst about the military after the visit is unbecoming. Olowu said; ” the outburst of Dokubo that the military was responsible for the oil theft after his visit to Mr President is unbecoming. It’s a betrayal of trust. Why should he use the presidential press glery to make such statement that’s capable of demoralising our military?” If he has any information about some unscrupulous elements in the military involved in oil theft, he can pass it unto Mr President without that undue sensationalism. It’s uncalled for, With the supreme sacrifice our military had made and forces of insurgency and associated unrest across the country it’s grappling with daily in order to keep Nigeria as one, that statement is tantamount to breaking their spirit; it’s not the best.” the monarch counselled. It will be recalled that Dokubo after meeting President Tinubu at the Aso Rock Villa yesterday accused the military of being responsible for the oil theft in the Niger Delta.
