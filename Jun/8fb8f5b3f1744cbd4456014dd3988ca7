LAGOS – Presidential candidate in the last general elections, Prince Adewole Adebayo has criticized the recent dissolution of the local government Council administration by the plateau state governor Mr. Caleb Mutfwtang. Adebayo said it is unconstitutional for state governors to dissolve Local Government Council administration they met on the ground as all electoral votes, whether at the national, state or local government levels are all the same. Adebayo’s admonition came in view of the Plateau State governor’s suspension of the 17 local government area council administrations. Mutfwtang said the suspension was based on the inability of the chairmen to make available records of their income and expenditure to the State House of Assembly even as he has sworn in immediately an interim transition committee chairmen. Adebayo said it is unconstitutional misconduct of state governors to dissolve such administration when their tenure hasn’t elapsed. “Unconstitutional misconduct of State Governors whimsically dissolving LGA Councils they met on the ground is undemocratic and grossly illegal. All votes are equally sovereign. It is the same electorates that vote in National, State, and Local Government elections. All are sacred.” He advised the Plateau governor to restore dissolved local government councils in compliance with the Supreme Court judgment. He said: “Plateau State Governor and other despots should promptly restore dissolved LG Councils in compliance with Supreme Court judgement in Yantaba vs Governor of Katsina State (2022) 1 NWLR PT. 1811 AT 259, and other Supreme Court judgements enforcing section 7(1) of the Constitution”.
