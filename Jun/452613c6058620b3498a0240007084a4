The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said it has not devalued the Naira as it has been reported by an Abuja-based national newspaper. The bank, in a statement signed by its Acting Director, Corporate communication Isa AbdulMumin on Thursday said the bank has not made any adjustment to the naira at Nigerian Foreign Exchange Market. The bank said, “The attention of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has been drawn to a news report by Daily Trust Newspaper Of June 1, 2023, titled “CBN Devalues Naira To 630/$1”. “We wish to state categorically that this news report, which in the imagination of the newspaper is exclusive, is replete with outright falsehoods and destabilizing innuendos, reflecting potentially willful ignorance of the said medium as to the workings of the Nigerian Foreign Exchange Market”. For the avoidance of doubt, Dr Isa Abdulmumin, said the exchange rate at the Investors’& Exporters’(I&E) window traded this morning (June 1, 2023) at N465/US$1 and has been stable around this rate for a while. “The public is hereby advised to ignore the news report by Daily Trust in its entirety, as it is speculative and calculated at causing panic in the market. “Media practitioners are advised to verify their facts from the Central Bank of Nigeria before publishing in order not to misinform the public,” Abdulmumin added.
