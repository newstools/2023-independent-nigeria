LAGOS – WhatsApp, the Meta-owned mes­saging app, is coming up with an­other update for its user worldwide through its Google Play Beta Pro­gram taking the app’s version up to 2.23.13.16. In recent weeks, the app has been introducing various changes to its in­terface for Android users such as the inclusion of a bottom navigation bar, redesigned switches, floating action buttons, and rounded menus. With its commitment towards Material Design 3’s principles, the app strives to regularly improve its interface, showing its dedication to its future plans of improving user experience. The Meta-owned application, this time around, is working to bring a white action bar update for its mil­lions of users worldwide which will soon be available, WABetaInfo re­ported. “We think the white action bar is achieving greater alignment with Material Design 3 principles: by tran­sitioning to a white color scheme, WhatsApp aligns its design more closely with the principles of Ma­terial Design, ensuring a consistent and revamped look,” the WhatsApp updates website mentioned. Users familiar with similar apps, according to the WhatsApp infor­mation website, will appreciate this change as it aligns with their expec­tations and guidelines. WhatsApp’s future changes in­clude more than just a light theme, as the application also intends to introduce a darker action bar to go with the dark theme. “In addition, the status bar is still configured using the old green color as shown in the attached screenshot, but this might be addressed later,” WABetaInfo mentioned. POLL The website added that the white action bar is currently under devel­opment and will soon be released for beta testers.
