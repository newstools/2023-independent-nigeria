The profile of Super Eagles Victor Osimhen has continued to rise with the globally-acknowledged site, Transfermarket, rating him the fourth most valuable player in the world with a price tag of €120 million. The rating placed Osimhen only behind Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe, Manchester City’s Erling Haaland, and Real Madrid’s Vinicius Junior. Mbappe and Haaland are worth €180m after a €10m upgrade on the Norwegian from his previous value of €170m. Vinicius is worth €150m while Osimhen is joint-fourth in value with Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka and Jude Bellingham of Real Madrid. Before the close of last season, the Nigerian top goal-banger was worth €100m but his value further increased last week. His clubmate, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia who won the most valuable player in the Italian top-flight last term is only worth €85m. Osimhen played a very critical role in Napoli winning their first Scudetto in 33 years where he contributed 26 goals. The 24-year-old also scored five goals in the UEFA Champions League, taking his total tally for the season to 31. Osimhen is among the most wanted striker by top clubs across Europe. These include Manchester United, Chelsea, and Bayern Munich. This year, he emerged as the best foreign athlete in Italy. He joined Napoli in 2020 for a club-record fee of over €70m paid to Lille of France. So far, Osimhen has surpassed George Weah’s record of most goals by an African player in Serie A. He exceeded Samuel Eto’o’s most goal by an African in a single Serie A season. The Nigerian won the topscorer’s award in Italy for his incredible goalscoring feat, becoming the first African ever to win it. POLL According to reports, Napoli will insist on €150m in his new deal from any club that wants him this summer. Osimhen’s goal-scoring form for Napoli has positioned him as one of the favorites to become the African Player of the Year.
