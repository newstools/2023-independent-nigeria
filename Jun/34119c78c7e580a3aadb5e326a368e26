LAGOS – ENGIE Energy Access has present­ed cash prizes to the top three win­ners of the ‘Innovation Challenge,’ a technology-leveraged hackathon aimed to task students on innova­tive solutions. A statement by the media con­sultant to the company said the challenge was organised as part of this year’s annual energy event, ‘The Industry Discourse’ (TID). The 2023 edition was organised by undergraduates at the Universi­ty of Lagos recently. The statement hinted that the ‘Industry Discourse’ is the largest student-led energy conference in the sub-Saharan Africa region, which focuses on bridging the gap between students and the energy industry, fostering synergy and giv­ing young people the opportunity to contribute positively to Africa’s energy future. As part of the company’s Cor­porate Social Responsibility (CSR) investment, ENGIE Energy Access supported the Industry Discourse and further demonstrated its com­mitment by providing a financial contribution of $3,000 for the Inno­vation Challenge The first team, PERIHELION, won a sum of $1,500; the second team, TEMT Energy, won $1,000, and the third-place team AGROLL won $500. Mangiza Phiri, Managing Direc­tor of ENGIE Energy Access Ni­geria, emphasised the company’s commitment to addressing the en­ergy access challenge in Nigeria and other African countries with underserved communities due to low-capacity national grids.
