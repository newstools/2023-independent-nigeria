The Lagos State Traffic Man­agement Authority (LASTMA) said it has been drawn to the re­curring fake news circulating on social media, purported to have been said by the Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, that “Henceforth no LASTMA officials should arrest any motorist, either com­mercial or private. The duty of LASTMA is to manage traffic and not to arrest”. A statement by the Director, Public Affairs and Enlighten­ment Department of LAST­MA, Mr. Adebayo Taofiq said the General Manager of the Agency, Mr. Bolaji Oreagba, had previously debunked the fake online news alleging that LASTMA Officials were banned from arresting motor­ists who flout the Lagos State Transport Sector Reform Law, 2018. Mr. Oreagba explained that the false report, which is the handiwork of faceless mischief makers, has been repeatedly circulated online since Febru­ary 2020 despite being severally refuted by the management of LASTMA. He warned Lagosians, espe­cially motorists, to be wary of online reports aimed at causing chaos and mischief within the society. “I wonder why some individ­uals choose to always mislead others to contravene the traffic law of the State as amended by the State House of Assembly in 2018”, he noted. General Manager hinted that part of the agency’s re­sponsibility is to uphold and enforce the traffic laws of the State, maintaining that the of­ficers and men of LASTMA will not hesitate to enforce those laws whenever violated to transform the State’s trans­portation system towards en­suring the free flow of traffic and reducing road accidents.
