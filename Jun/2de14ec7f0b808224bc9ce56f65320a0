The company has taken a measurable approach to reducing emissions by leading the way in sustainable oil exploration and production, it said in a statement. “With its approach to tracking and reducing scope 1 and scope 2 emissions in the Nigerian oil and gas industry, NDW is committed to playing a central part in the Energy Transition. NDW’s gas focus is one way that the company plans to achieve emissions reduction targets that align with reaching net zero by the year 2050” it added. To monitor its progress towards Net Zero, the company uses specific guidance on reporting emissions for the oil and gas industry as provided in the “Oil and gas industry guidance on voluntary sustainability reporting guidelines”, produced by IPIECA (formerly the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association). The IPIECA guidelines, which NDW adopts, are industry specific and recommend a series of discrete activities that should be estimated and reported by oil and gas companies.
