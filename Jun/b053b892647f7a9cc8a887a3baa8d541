Outgoing Senate President, Ahmad Lawan has denied endorsing former Akwa-Ibom governor, Godswill Akpabio as his successor ahead of the inauguration of the 10th National Assembly tomorrow. Earlier, a viral picture of President Bola Tinubu with Akpabio and Lawan taken in Aso Villa had gone viral with many claiming Lawan had given his backing to Akpabio. However speaking with our correspondent, a source in Lawan’s camp said contrary to the reports, Akpabio and Lawan only met at the June 12 Democracy Day celebration where they took pictures together. “No, the report of any endorsement is not true. Lawan has not endorsed anyone and has not granted any interview saying he is backing anybody. As for now, no one knows his mind as he has kept his card close to his chest. “Today, Lawan and Akpabio met in Aso Villa for the 2023 celebration of June 12 democracy day and they took photographs together with the president. That is the picture being circulated by Akpabio’s camp as an endorsement. They are just throwing the report around to gain sympathy. Nothing of such took place” the source said.
