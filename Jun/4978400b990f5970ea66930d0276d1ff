Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has placed his armed forces on “full combat readiness” following the Wagner mutiny in Russia. The president – a close Putin ally – was speaking to journalists following a meeting with security chiefs, with details of the deal he helped to broker that ended the uprising said to have been under discussion. “It was painful to watch the events that took place in the south of Russia,” he said. “Not only me. Many of our citizens took them to heart because we have one fatherland.” The dictator appeared to mount a defence of his own regime, which harshly put down peaceful protests in 2021. “You all hear reproaches against me: for 30 years I have been preparing for war. That’s why today we live under a peaceful sky,” said Mr Lukashenko. Details of the deal with Wagner remain unclear with reports that leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has arrived in the Belarusian capital city Minsk after an agreement with Mr Lukashenko to halt the mutiny. Russia President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that the Wagner chief remained under investigation over the uprising. Wagner fighters, many of them prisoners, are also expected to relocate to Belarus with reports of camps being built to house them. POLL Belarus has been one of Russia’s few allies throughout the war and President Putin recently announced plans to move nuclear weapons to its territory. “Belarus has the technical capabilities to deal with the threat from the West,” warned Mr Lukashenko. He said that “if Russia collapses, we’ll be left under the wreckage. Everyone will die.”
