Bayelsa State Governor Douye Diri has expressed deep sadness over the twin accidents that claimed the lives of at least 10 Ijaw indigenes on Sunday. In one of the crashes along the Kogi-Abuja road, six band members of a popular Ijaw musician, Barrister Smooth, died while the other accident along the Kwale-Asaba highway in Delta State claimed four supporters of the Bayelsa Queens Football Club. Diri in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah, on Monday, described it as a Black Sunday for Bayelsa and the Ijaw nation. He said the state was thrown into mourning as news of the sad incidents filtered in. The governor said their deaths were painful as these youths were active and impacting lives through their musical talent as well as following their passion to support the state’s darling female football team. He said, “On behalf of the government and people of Bayelsa State, I extend our deepest sympathies to the families of the deceased. “I also commiserate with the leader of the band, Barrister Smooth. “These are very unfortunate and sad incidents that claimed the lives of our active youths. POLL “It is a great loss to our state and the Ijaw nation as young talents and bread winners following their passion had suddenly departed. “I pray that the Lord consoles the families for the painful loss that they have suffered. “I also pray for quick healing and recovery for those that were injured.”
