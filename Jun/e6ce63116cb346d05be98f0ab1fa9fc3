As Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State inaugurated commissioners and members of the State Executive Council on Tuesday, June 13, fresh details have emerged as to why there are no commissioners from three Etsako Local Government Areas in the cabinet yet. The three local councils include Etsako Central, Etsako East and Etsako West. Impeccable sources with knowledge of the political happenings in the state revealed to DAILY INDEPENDENT that the commissioner slots for the three local councils were not filled because the deputy governor of the state, Comrade Philip Shaibu, did not attend meetings called to reach a consensus on the list of commissioners from the affected area. A source, who pleaded anonymity, said: “Meetings were called and the deputy governor, Shaibu, did not attend. It is not known what the reasons are but his absence was what resulted in the area not having commissioners. “We expect that the meetings will be held and commissioners would eventually be appointed into the cabinet from the three Etsako LGAs.” It was also learnt that a commissioner has not been appointed in Egor Local Government Area because the leaders from the local council have been unable to reach a consensus on a candidate. According to the source: “For Egor, the leaders are yet to harmonise and agree on a nominee. We expect that a commissioner will be appointed as soon as things are ironed out among the leaders.”
