Imo State Government has been given a one month ultimatum to fully implement the White paper that indicted the immediate past Senator that represented Imo West, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, of looting more than N130 billion from the State’s coffers while he was Governor. At a world press conference in Owerri Wednesday, a Non Gov­ernmental Organization (NGO), Sincere Concern Organization Inc, regretted that the non im­plementation of the White pa­per has emboldened the former Governor to attempt to return to Government through a proxy. The Director General of the Organization, Mrs Foluke Ola­bimbe Lemechi said the group was saddened that two years af­ter the publication of the White paper which indicted the former Governor of widespread looting, the Government was foot drag­ging on the issue. It noted that Okorocha has taken advantage of that lacuna to now plot on how to sponsor a candidate for the November Gov­ernorship election in Imo State so as to escape justice. It declared: “We don’t want the victims of Okorocha’s brin­gandage and open robbery to die before the emperor is brought to justice. We don’t want to wait until Okorocha succeeds in in­stalling a stooge as Governor to continue the looting spree before he is stopped.” The group disclosed that if at the expiration of the one month ultimatum, the Imo State Gov­ernment has not moved against Okorocha to return the stolen money and assets, it would mo­bilize the youths to act through lawful means. The group said: “if after the expiration of the ultimatum, Okorocha has not returned the money or he is not in jail, we shall take lawful steps to ensure that justice is served so that would be Public Office holders would not think that it is a norm to steal from the public purse and go scot free.”
