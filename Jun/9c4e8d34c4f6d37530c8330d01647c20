Julius Berger Nigeria Plc has assured the Federal Govern­ment and indeed all Nigerians that ply the Abuja-Kaduna-Kano highway that the completed sections 1 and 2 of the road was constructed with international­ly-acknowledged due diligence and best practices. The Execu­tive Director, Administration, Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, Alhaji Zubairu Ibrahim Bayi gave the assurance at the project commis­sioning ceremony recently. Bayi, who represented the company’s managing director at the project commissioning cere­mony, gave the sincere apologies of the MD for his absence at the Kano event because he had to be at the Second River Niger Bridge ceremony to receive Mr. President. According to Alhaji Bayi, “The managing director has asked me to convey his profound regrets for his absence at this event due to compelling circum­stances. Our Managing Director, Engr. Dr. Lars Richter, however, sends his sincere congratu­lations to you, Mr. President, and to the entire good people of Nigeria, and in particular to the commuters that will benefit from this all-important road.” Alhaji Bayi, who called for good maintenance of the im­portant infrastructure, said: “I am humbled to announce to this gathering that this strategic road was executed in accordance with international due diligence and best practice; an established hallmark of the Julius Berger Nigeria Plc engineering con­struction standard.” Bayi added, ”It is our prayer and hope that the road manage­ment and maintenance agencies will put in place the highest maintenance culture with a view to harnessing maximum benefit to justify the investment made by the government on this project.” He announced to the august gathering that while Julius Berger Nigeria put a total of about 14 million man-hours of work into the construction and completion of the engineering masterpiece, the company re­corded a 2.8 accident feat (that is, 1 accident per two million hours) on the project while it lasted.
