According to AS, Deco’s first job at Barcelona as a technical secretary will be to go head to head with Real Madrid for the acquisition of Turkish sensation Arda Guler. It has been reported that the 18-year-old attacking midfielder, who scored six goals in 35 appearances for Fenerbahce last season, has a release clause worth €17.5 million. A left-footed attacking midfielder with an eye for a goal and vision, Guler has been tipped as the ‘Turkish Messi’ by people in his homeland. For the moment, many top teams are said to be trying to convince the player and Barcelona happen to be one of them. The mentioned fee at which the young prodigy is available is well within Barcelona’s reach and it is said that the management is considering him as a perfect market opportunity. At the same time, those sitting in the Blaugrana offices also understand that his performance has not gone unnoticed. At the moment, many top teams have approached him with an offer, including Real Madrid. The 18-year-old wants to leave Turkey right away and Deco will have to approach him accordingly. Deco, being the main guy in the sporting department at Barcelona, seems to be heading the operation and he must make sure Barcelona provide the young player with everything he is asking for. Interestingly enough, as reported before Deco, who was thought to be Jordi Cryuff’s replacement, has assumed a bigger role than his predecessor. POLL When it comes to transfer dealings, the former midfielder will make all big decisions and his initial task is to identify specific players that could help the team next season. And now that he has identified Guler, he must make sure the operation is executed before Real Madrid make their move.
