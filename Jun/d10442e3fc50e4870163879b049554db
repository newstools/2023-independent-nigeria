Even though Barcelona have brought in Ilkay Gundogan to reinforce their interior midfield positions, manager Xavi Hernandez is said to be on the lookout for another player who could possibly arrive at a low cost and provide goals and creativity from the centre. As such, SPORT is now reporting that Barcelona have been offered an opportunity to sign Bayern Munich outcast Marcel Sabitzer in the summer. Sabitzer signed for Bayern Munich in 2021 from RB Leipzig in a deal worth €15 million. However, the Austrian international failed to take off at the Allianz Arena and quickly fell down the pecking order. Having hardly played regularly, Sabitzer joined Manchester United on loan in January earlier this year. And even though there were some positive glimpses of his ability, the 29-year-old was held back by injuries. As such, he is now back at Bayern Munich, who have no need for him. Even though Manchester United are understood to be negotiating a potential permanent transfer for the Austrian, his entourage has offered his services to Barça. Sabitzer is a versatile operator who can play in a multitude of positions in midfield and attack. However, given Barcelona’s current situation, their priority is likely to be a direct replacement for departed captain Sergio Busquets. And the 29-year-old Sabitzer is not particularly well-versed in acting as a pivot. So, even though Xavi is said to be considering the possibility of signing another attack-minded central midfielder such as Giovani Lo Celso, that position is not a priority. So, it appears likely that Barcelona will pass up on the opportunity to sign Sabitzer, who still has two years left on his contract with Bayern Munich and has a market value of €20 million.
