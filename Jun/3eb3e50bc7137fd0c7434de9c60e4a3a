Borussia Dortmund have confirmed that Jude Bellingham will join Real Madrid for an initial €103 million (£88.4m) fee. In a statement released on Wednesday, the Bundesliga club also announced that the deal could see Madrid pay a further €30.9m (£26.5m) in performance-related add-ons. Since joining Dortmund from Birmingham City for an initial £25m fee in 2020, Bellingham has established himself as one of the finest midfielders in Europe. Ahead of the summer transfer window, the 19-year-old had attracted interest from several clubs including Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United. But Bellingham has opted to join Madrid and could end up becoming the most expensive English player of all time if his transfer fee overtakes the £100m Manchester City paid to sign Jack Grealish from Aston Villa in 2021. Bellingham also becomes only the sixth English player to sign for Madrid after Laurie Cunningham, Steve McManaman, David Beckham, Michael Owen and Jonathan Woodgate. More to follow… (SOURCE: Metro UK)
