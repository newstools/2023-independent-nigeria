The Profit before Tax dropped by 5.26% to N157.902 billion as against N166.662 billion posted in 2021. According to the bank in a statement, Net Interest Income rose by 59.15% to N363.249 billion from N228.242 billion in 2021. This is on the back of increasing inflation, for which the economy continues to struggle. Gross earnings grew by 6.3% to N805.1 billion (Dec 2021: N757.3billion). This was driven by strong growth in interest income (+49.6% y-o-y) to N551.9 billion (Dec 2021: N369.0 billion). The increase in interest income benefited primarily from 31.5% y-o-y growth in loans to customers. This was further supported by the higher interest rate environment, which positively impacted yields. On the other hand, interest expense growth of 34.0% y-o-y to N188.7 billion (Dec 2021: N140.8 billion), was contained following strategic growth in deposit mobilisation and funding at optimised rates. As a result, net interest income improved impressively by 59.2% y-o-y to N363.2 billion (Dec 2021: N228.2 billion).
