Prince Segun Ochuko Obayendo, FinsTA, the President of the Chartered Institute of Transport Administration (CIOTA), has expressed deep concern over a tragic incident that occurred on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway in the early hours of Friday, resulting in the loss of a truck driver’s life. The unfortunate incident according to a press release signed by Chinwe Uwaegbute, National Publicity Secretary, CIOTA, occurred when the truck driver lost control and collided with another tanker from behind, leading to the immediate fatality of the driver. It reads further that CIOTA President Prince Segun Ochuko Obayendo, emphasises that such avoidable accidents during daylight hours should not become the norm, “It is imperative that we revisit the policy allowing truck drivers to exclusively operate on our roads at midnight.” He called upon the relevant agencies responsible for ensuring highway safety to take decisive actions to prevent these incidents from becoming a recurring occurrence. Obayendo according to the release tasked the Truck Owners Association ofNigeria to prioritise the physical fitness of its members before allowing them to operate on the roads. He also used the medium to ask the government to undertake deliberate investments in railway infrastructure nationwide for the transportation of highly inflammable goods. And to the family of the deceased, the statement reads, “During this difficult time we extend our heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased truck driver. CIOTA remains committed to advocating for the safety and welfare of all transport stakeholders.”
