IBADAN – Rising from an emergency meeting of more than five hundred support groups, the National Coalition of Independent Support Groups for BAT and Shettima (NCISGBS) has reiterated their support for the federal government on the fuel subsidy removal, urging Nigerians to persevere for a little time to enjoy policy thereafter. This was contained in a communique issued and made available to newsmen on Thursday which stated that the NCISGBS solidly supports the Federal Government’s decision to obliterate the continued scam called Petroleum Subsidy. “That President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and his Government should never succumb to the blackmail being surreptitiously hatched by the faceless Oil Subsidy Cabal in further impoverishing the ordinary citizens of Nigeria. “That the Coalition commends the President’s extraordinary courage and sense of direction in completely consigning this bad dream called Petroleum Subsidy into the trash-bin of Nigeria’s History”. Abubakar Abdullahi, the President General of Nigeria Coalition of Independent Support Groups who signed the communique further reiterated the Coalition’s stance in supporting the Federal Government’s efforts in revitalizing and reinvigorating the country’s economic architecture. He, however, implored the totality of Nigerians to support the Federal Government in its plan to make Nigeria our El Dorado.
