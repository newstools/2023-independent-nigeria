In a significant moment for Africa’s fundraising sector, Grant Master, a pioneer in the grant writing marketplace, has been honoured as the “Fundraising Champion of the Year” at the esteemed 2023 Origo International Excellence Awards. Originating from Canada, Origo International annually conducts these awards, recognising individuals and organizations worldwide that have excelled remarkably in their respective domains. The award ceremony, held on June 25, 2023, at the NECA House Event Centre in Ikeja, Lagos, saw Grant Master triumphantly standing out for its innovative and inspiring contribution to the fundraising industry. Operating in a fast-paced sector, Grant Master has embarked on a successful journey by offering accelerated, debt-free, and equity-free funding solutions for a host of leading African brands and startups. The platform provides a unique matchmaking service, connecting organizations with professional grant writers to streamline the process of fund acquisition. Olugbenga Ogunbowale, Co-founder and CEO of Grant Master, spoke passionately on receiving the accolade, “Running a business in Africa is tough. Money, being the lifeblood of business, has traditionally been sourced through loans or investors. “At Grant Master, we aimed to offer a third option. Every time we assist a business in winning a grant, we are supporting job creation, increasing access to critical services, and making a significant impact. “This honour not only recognizes our relentless effort in revolutionizing the fundraising industry but also reaffirms our commitment to maintaining a seamless grant acquisition process for our clients.” POLL Being the first of its kind in Africa, Grant Master has simplified the funding process for organizations and ensured financial stability through groundbreaking initiatives such as her creative writers’ fellowship. Additionally, Grant Master has recently been recognized as one of the top 10 African startups in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s U.S.-Africa Business Center (USAfBC) Africa Digital Innovation Competition. This recognition further solidifies its status as a critical influencer in Africa’s digital innovation sector. The acknowledgement from Origo International Excellence Awards underscores Grant Master’s role in reshaping the fundraising industry, marking it as an innovation and inspiration beacon for organizations across Africa.
