The suspended Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, has been arrested by the Department of State Security, DSS. Prior to Emefieleâ€™s suspension, the DSS, on December 7, 2022, in an exparte application with reference no: FHC/ABJ/CS/2255/2022, sought an order to arrest the CBN Governor. The DSS accused Emefiele of financing terrorism, fraudulent activities and economic crimes of national security dimension. The Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice J.T Tsoho, however, refused to grant the application of the DSS. The court said such an application should have been accompanied with the presidential approval because of the grave implications for the Nigerian economy if the CBN governor is arrested and detained.
