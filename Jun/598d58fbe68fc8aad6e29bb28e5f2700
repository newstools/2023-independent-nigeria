Management of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said its financial statements are duly audited over the years contrary to the recent reports in the elec­tronic and print media, which stated that the Commission had not audited its financial statements since 2014. In a statement released on Friday, the management said the Commission has duly au­dited its financial accounts year after year before and on­ward from 2014. “The attention of the Se­curities and Exchange Com­mission (the Commission), the apex regulator of the Nigerian capital market has been drawn to some reports in the electronic and print media, insinuating that the Commission had not audit­ed its financial statements since 2014. Contrary to these false claims, the Commission as a law-abiding agency has duly audited its financial ac­counts year after year before and onward from 2014, and has submitted these to the relevant agencies statutorily empowered by the Federal Government to receive same, including the Federal Minis­try of Finance, Budget and National Planning; Office of the Auditor General of the Federation; Fiscal Responsi­bility Commission; Office of the Accountant General of the Federation, as well as the appropriate committees of the National Assembly.
