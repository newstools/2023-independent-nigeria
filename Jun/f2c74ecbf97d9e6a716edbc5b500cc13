He has also brought development to Bauchi state where he built schools, constructed roads, places of worship and empowered people of the state, especially in his constituency,” he said. Also Speaking, one of the member of the group, Kashim Ibrahim said that President Tinubu transformed Lagos state when he was governor where he used the money generated from the Internally Generated Revenue to the run affairs of the state, adding that with the likes of Dogara in his cabinet, the president will record more development for the country. “No matter the great plans President Tinubu has for the country, if he does not have the rigth people in his government, he cannot achieve much, no matter how hard he tries.When the right people are in place, the work is easier and the country will be positioned for more development” he said POLL Also Speaking, Mr Michael Gizmo Damina, another member of the group, urged President Tinubu to consider Bauchi state for ministerial appointment by appointing Dogara who is one of the strong pillars of APC in the state, pointing out that he worked for the progress of the party where he delivered his constituency and was instrumental to the many of seats won by the APC in the National Assembly.
