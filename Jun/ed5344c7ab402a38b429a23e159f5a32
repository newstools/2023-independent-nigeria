Operatives of the Rivers State Police Command have arrested two of its personnel over alleged extortion of citizens. According to reports, the officers were apprehended following a complaint by a young man that the security operatives extorted him. The young man was said to have complained on Twitter and tagged the Force Public Relations Officer, CSP Adejobi Olumuyiwa, who in turn tweeted and queried the Rivers State Police Command on why people in the state are still complaining about extortion and harassment, despite several warnings by the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba. Responding via a tweet, the spokesperson for the Rivers State Police Command, Grace Iringe-Koko, confirmed the arrest of the erring police officers. It was gathered that the arrested officers were attached to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department of the Rivers State Police Command.
