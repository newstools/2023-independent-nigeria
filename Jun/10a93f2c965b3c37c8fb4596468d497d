Operatives of the Adamawa State Police Command have arrested a man identified as Amos Christopher for allegedly beating his younger brother to death and beheading him. The police established that 24-year-old Amos beat up his youngest sibling called Thyson until he died before he went on to cut his head. The deceased was four years old. Amos, who is from Dobi village in Ga’anda District, Gombi LGA, is said to be suffering from epilepsy, but it is unclear how the condition may have influenced his actions. According to reports, Amos descended on little Thyson the previous day, June 19, “when his health condition became worse.” A source who spoke on the matter said, “Amos had a seizure outside and slumped on the 18th of June, 2023, and was brought back home by neighbors. “His health condition deteriorated with a complete change in his behavior the following morning when he violently attacked his mother and younger brothers who were at home with him. “He grabbed the 4-year-old boy and dragged him into a room where he locked up the door from inside and beat him up to death. All effort to rescue the small boy from his mother was fruitless. POLL “He carried the dead body outside where he used the hoe in his possession and cut off the head.” The Spokesman of the Adamawa Police Command, SP Suleiman Nguroje, said the suspect had been saying that he did not do anything and that his younger brother he was said to have killed is alive and at home. The father of the suspect, Christopher Haruna, said the incident occurred while he was away in his farm. He confirmed that Amos has epilepsy and the family had been battling to cure it.
