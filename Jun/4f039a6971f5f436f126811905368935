……………Demands For The Establishment of Artisanal Modular Refineries Devt Commission AMRDCO The Coalition of Urhobo and lsoko Ex – Agitators in Delta State has called on President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to use his Executive fiat to terminate with immediate effect the Pipeline Surveillance Contract of Senator Ovie Omo-Agege due to his alleged opaque practice, diversion and suppression of NNPCL pipeline surveillance slots, meant for Urhobo and lsoko Youths. The Placards carrying Protesting Urhobo – Isoko Youths Who came out in large crowd along DSC Road by Express junction in Udu LGA of Delta State condemned in all ramifications what they called the Omo-Agege greed to corner what belongs to them. The angry Ex – Agitators in a Press statement signed by their Chairman, Comrade Godspower Okoro made available to newsmen reads in part: “We the aggrieved Youths of Urhobo and lsoko hereby call for the immediate arrest, prosecution and termination of the pipeline surveillance contract awarded to Senator Ovie Omo-Agege. We also plead for Mr. President to kindly approve the establishment of Artisanal Modular Refineries Development Commission (AMRDCO) to put an end to all forms of illegal bunkering in the Niger Delta region.” The group which harped on the need for Omo-Agege to be brought to book said: “Sequel to the earlier Ultimatum given by the coalition of the Urhobo and Isoko Ex-Agitators on the 9th March, 2023, which was widely circulated in the print and electronic media but fell on the deaf ears of Senator Ovie Omo -Agege , we the Leadership of Coalition of Urhobo and Isoko Ex-Agitators wish to call on the good office of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and other relevant agencies of Government to swing into action for the immediate arrest and prosecution of Senator Ovie Omo-Agege over his unlawful and illegal diversion/suppression of NNPCL pipeline surveillance slots belonging to Urhobo and Isoko Ex-Agitators.” The placard carrying Urhobo and Isoko Youths pointed out during the protest that this ungodly action taken by the former Deputy Senate President, has brought so much hardship and restiveness to Urhobo and lsoko land, a situation which made it paramount and imparity for us the Urhobo and Isoko Ex-Agitators to carry out this protest and to send this Save Our Soul (SOS) message to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to use his Executive Fiat to bring the greedy Senator Omo-Agege to justice. POLL The angry Youths stated further that: Senator Omo-Agege who influenced the Pipeline Surveillance Contract to be awarded to his proxy, named Jimmy Omo-Agege refused to engage the youths of Urhobo and Isoko, hence we are calling for justice and equity to prevail on this matter.The Urhobo and lsoko Ex – Agitators insisted that Senator Ovie Omo-Agege should be made to face the law because EMNA FLEETS a Pipeline Surveillance Company, owned by Chief Emami Ayeri and Tantita Security Company Owned by High Chief Government Oweizide Ekpomupolo, aka Tompolo pays their supervisors N300,000 and field boys N200,000 monthly, while the Caeser and Emperor of Orogun is paying his selected kinsmen who play his bidding a paltry sum of N60,000. The Youths lamented during the protest saying: “It will interest you and the general public to know that Senator Ovie Omo-Agege used the Pipeline Surveillance Contract work as a political tool during the last 2023 governorship elections by making it mandatory for the Youths who were selected to work with him to first, renounce publicly their membership from other political parties before they can be considered for the pipeline surveillance job, even though their salaries was nothing but a pittance of N60,000.” Shedding more light on the issue, the rampaging youths continued: “We challenge Senator Ovie Omo-Agege to produce evidence of complete payment to his cronies who are engaged in the pipeline surveillance work that are receiving as much as the Ayeri and Tompolo boys.” The statement further remarked: “Since President Tinubu Government is determined to make positive impact, we stressed that the Senator Ovie Omo-Agege arm twisting game should be nipped in the bud without fear or favour in the interest of all.” Comrade Ogaga Ivwromon who also spoke to newsmen during the protest said: “In addition to my brother’s speech, the Isoko and Urhobo nation currently produces about 32 percent of the Nation’s Oil Output, ordinarily, one would have expected us to benefit massively from the Nation’s Petroleum Sector, but unfortunately, the Orogun Emperor has not only denied us such benefits but have cornered everything to himself and family and left others to their fate.”Comrade Ogaga Ivwromon continued with enthusiasm saying: “My emphasis is to re-echo the call for the termination of the NNPCL Pipeline Surveillance Contract for Urhobo and Isoko Nation currently being managed by Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, because we have not benefited anything from it as oil bearing communities.”Ogaga called on President Tinubu to make the establishment of Artisanal Modular Refinery Commission with Head Quarters at Uzere Town and Petroleum Technical College, Oleh Town as part of his one hundred days project in office, stressing that the creation of the commission will create jobs and bring about peace in the region as small players in the oil sector will be documented and their activities control by the commission. While speaking on Amnesty matters Ogaga said: “Finally we call on President Tinubu to direct Major General Barry Ndiomu of the Presidential Amnesty program to recognize the undocumented ex- agitators with JTF clearance and commence their monthly payment from the recently recovered slots in the agency audit report.”Comrade Jonah Marshall and Timibra Gabriel who also expressed dissatisfaction over the agony and the pitiable condition of the Urhobo and Isoko Youths said: “Despite our enormous oil wealth, I am presently riding Okada on the basis of balance and carry for seven hundred thousand naira for the owner, because Omo-Agege has hijacked the Pipeline Surveillance job that was given to us by President Tinubu, hence our protest because the suffering in the midst of abundance is too-much for us and family members.”
