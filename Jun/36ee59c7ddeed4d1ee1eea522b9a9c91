GOMBE – Gombe State Governor, Mu­hammad Inuwa Yahaya, has charged intending Muslim Pilgrims from the state to in­tensify prayers for God’s in­tervention over the nation’s socio-economic realities. The governor gave the charge during a farewell ad­dress to the state’s first batch of intending Muslim pilgrims at the Gombe State Muslim Pil­grims’ Welfare Board office. Governor Yahaya told the intending Pilgrims before their movement to Saudi Ara­bia to “Intensify prayers for yourselves, Gombe State and Nigeria for God’s intervention into our recent experiences”. He said: “Nigeria is faced with multifaceted challenges, that only through the merciful intervention from the God Al­mighty we can get through”. Speaking on their conduct, Governor Yahaya urged them to remain law-abiding and be good ambassadors of the state and Nigeria while in the Holy Land. According to him, “While in the Holy Land, please be good ambassadors of your­selves; good ambassadors of your communities, your local government areas, Gombe State and Nigeria, so we can all be proud of you”. He urged them to stay free of anything that may mar their spiritual exercise, per­sonal or state’s reputation, re­minding them that in the Holy Land, law can take its cause on anybody found wanting of any mischievous or unwhole­some act. While wishing them a hitch-free Hajj exercise, the governor encouraged them to intimate their guides on any­thing they do not understand, adding that his administra­tion is on its feet to ensure the state pilgrims have the best Hajj experience right from Nigeria to the Holy Land.
