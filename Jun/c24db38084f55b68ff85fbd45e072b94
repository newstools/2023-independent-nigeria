LAGOS – The Yoruba Socio-cultural group, Afenifere, has written the Ogun State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), denying an earlier statement reportedly issued by the organisation. The Punch newspaper had published a story early Tuesday, purportedly signed by the Organising Secretary of the group, who identified himself as Abagun Kole Omololu, wherein he accused Ogun APC of insulting Otunba Gbenga Daniel, and even went further to ‘warn’ the party. Afenifere, in a letter signed by its Secretary General, Chief Sola Ebiseni, and directly addressed to the Assistant Publicity Secretary of Ogun APC, said the position of Organising Secretary, was vacant and such letter couldn’t have emanated from the office. The statement added that even if the office was occupied and functional, it is not part of the functions of the office to speak for the organization, saying Afenifere by its principle neither takes side nor plays to the gallery. “Further to your letter dated 27th June 2023 in respect of a publication in The Punch today on the alleged misunderstanding between Otunba Gbenga Daniel, former Governor of Ogun State and present Senator representing Ogun East Senatorial District and His Excellency, Dapo Abiodun, Governor of the State, please be informed that Afenifere is not aware of any such misunderstanding between the two eminent Yoruba personalities. ” In the event of such occurrence, which is not unnatural, Afenifere has time-honoured Yoruba modus operandi for result-oriented intervention, part of which is not taking a side or playing to the gallery. “The statement credited to the Afenifere was not made by the Organisation and we are utterly surprised that, by your position, you may not know that the office of the National Organising Secretary of Afenifere is vacant, the last holder thereof having been dismissed and his membership suspended as disciplinary measures for unauthorised and embarrassing public statements, which development the press is also not unaware of. “Besides, you may also wish to know that it is not part of the functions of the National Organising Secretary to speak for the Afenifere in public communications”, the statement read.
