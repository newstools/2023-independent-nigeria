As part of its continuous efforts to champion environmental responsibility and promote sustainable practices, the leading financial institution Union Bank of Nigeria partnered with the Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF) to celebrate World Environment Day 2023. World Environment Day, observed annually on June 5th, is a global platform to raise awareness, and mobilize action towards pressing environmental issues. The 2023 campaign, #BeatPlasticPollution; Solutions to Plastic Pollution, calls for global solutions to combat plastic pollution. Plastic pollution has become a global crisis, threatening our ecosystems, wildlife, and human well-being. This yearâ€™s World Environment Day aims to raise awareness and mobilize individuals, communities, and organizations to take action and make a positive impact on the environment by reducing their plastic consumption, embracing sustainable alternatives, and advocating for responsible plastic waste management. To create awareness of environmental responsibility and encourage collective action, Union Bank employees, together with the Nigerian Conservation Foundation volunteered to educate students at Aguda Junior Grammar School, Surulere, Greg Girls Junior High School, Surulere, and Okun Ajah Community Senior Secondary School, Okun Ajah. The students were educated on the detrimental effects of plastic pollution on the environment, highlighting the importance of reducing plastic consumption, reusing plastic, and practical tips for sustainable recycling. The Bank also donated waste bins to each school to encourage recycling and make it easier for students to do their part in reducing plastic waste.
