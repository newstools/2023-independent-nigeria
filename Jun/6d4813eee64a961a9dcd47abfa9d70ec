LAGOS – Africa’s smartphone market declined 3,4% quarter on quarter (QoQ) in Q1 2023 to total 17-million units, the lowest level of shipments since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in Q1 2020. This is according to the latest figures announced by International Data Corporation (IDC), with the firm’s newly released Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker showing that rising inflation and local currency depreciations against the US dollar have negatively impacted demand for smartphones across the continent. According to IDC, the sales in Africa mirrored other emerging markets as macroeconomic factors hit consumer pockets, leading to the decline in vendor shipments. IDC senior research analyst George Mbuthia said: “The average selling price (ASP) for smartphones grew QoQ due to high import costs and the fact that many vendors’ flagship devices are now equipped with 5G and have therefore moved up in price to the premium segment.” Transsion (Tecno, Itel, and Infinix) accounted for the largest share of smartphone shipments across Africa in Q1 2023, despite experiencing a decline in units. Samsung placed second, while Xiaomi came in third. IDC senior research manager Ramazan Yavuz added: “Looking ahead, a slight recovery in demand is expected starting from the second half of 2023, with uncertainty over a global recession lessening. Greater currency stability against the dollar will promote more stable pricing, and this is also expected to ease import costs and thus lower ASPs in the market, helping to spur slight growth throughout the remainder of the year.”
