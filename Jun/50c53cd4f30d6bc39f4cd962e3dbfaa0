ABUJA  – Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, former Senate Majority Whip, has said that the President of the Senate, Godswill Akpabio, won the Senate President election in a free, fair and credible manner. The former governor of Abia State was re­acting to media reports that some unnamed 22 senators of the All Pro­gressives Congress (APC) were planning to leave the party for another op­position party because of the outcome of the Senate election. According to Kalu, who spoke on a recorded video through his verified Face­book account, “Let me be honest with you, the elec­tion in the Senate was very transparent. Senator Akpa­bio won the election. It was free, it was fair. “I congratulate the Clerk of the National Assembly, I congratulate the Clerk and all the Staff of the Senate. You know I cannot lie against my conscience. Akpabio won the election hands down. “There was no contro­versy about who won the election. If there is any­thing any other person wants to say, that is their business. Akpabio, to my conscience, to my seeing and to my honour, won the election and we have since congratulated him,” he stated. Speaking further, Kalu, who also aspired for the of­fice of the President of the Senate, said: “There are no two Senates in the history of the Senate. There is only one Senate. June 13 was the day we decided to have one Senate. “There are no pro and anti Akpabio Senators. Even Senator Abdulaziz Yari understands we have to work with Akpabio. He is the Senate President. We have congratulated him and I am using this Sallah period to appeal to our people to come togeth­er and work as one Senate, he declared.”
