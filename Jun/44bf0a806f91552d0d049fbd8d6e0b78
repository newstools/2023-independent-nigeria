The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) has recommended an eleven-point action plan to the Federal government following the removal of fuel subsidy. ICAN in a statement signed by Professor Ahmed Kumshe, Registrar/ Chief Executive commended the bold steps taken by the new government to address market distortions and block revenue leakages, while calling for action plans to reduce the burden of such economic policy decisions and limit the burden on the populace especially small businesses and vulnerable households. ICAN said effective consul­tation and communication with all relevant stakeholders is critical for the introduction and implementation of any major policy, as it will facili­tate buy-in, broad support and ensure ease of implementa­tion. The Institute also stressed the need for the government to introduce credible pallia­tives to cushion the impact on the most vulnerable popu­lation beyond the civil service “In this regard, the govern­ment should design and im­plement palliatives for low-in­come earners especially in cities and towns where the cost of living will rise much higher. It should introduce policies that will bring down the cost of transportation and food. “Palliatives should be im­plemented at both the national and sub-national levels. Care should be taken to measure the cost of palliatives to be introduced to avoid re-intro­ducing another form of sub­sidy. This is where chartered accountants are needed. We do not support the borrowing of $800m for palliatives when the savings from the subsidy removal can be used for this purpose, saving the country from further debt and rising debt service costs. ICAN said there is still the need for full transparency and accountability of all ac­tivities within the oil and gas sector, that a situation where the public does not know the exact daily consumption of fuel is inexcusable.
