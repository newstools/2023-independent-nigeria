ABUJA  – Former governor of Delta State, James Ibori, in the compa­ny of former gover­nor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike and the governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, on Fri­day, visited Aso Rock, Abuja, to meet with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Speaking with the State House Correspondents af­ter their meeting, Governor Makinde, on behalf of the visitors said President Bola Tinubu requires the support of Nigerians to succeed in his decision to remove oil subsidy. Asked if the issue of subsi­dy was discussed during the meeting, Makinde said: “Yes. We discussed it. It is some­thing that is on top of public discourse now. We know it is a tough decision for the people and he needs the support of everybody to see it through.” The governor said he and the former governors were at the State House to show their support to President Tinubu. “He has started well and he has the support of the gener­ality of the people,” Makinde said. Others who met with the president on Friday were former Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi and his Kano State counterpart, Ab­dullahi Ganduje. Recall that Tinubu and Ibori served as governors be­tween 1999 and 2007. Wike and Makinde, both members of the Peoples Dem­ocratic Party, PDP, were very instrumental to the success of Tinubu in the 2023 general elections through the forma­tion of the G-5 group of gov­ernors.
