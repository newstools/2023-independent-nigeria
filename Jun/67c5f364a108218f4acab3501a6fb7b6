JOS – Bishop Jonas Katung Founder and General Overseer of A Body of The Living Stone Church Assembly Church has charged President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to ensure people of prov­en integrity and technocrats are nominated to form his much-ex­pected cabinet. Bishop Katung, a leading figure in Northern Pentecostal Bishops in an interview with newsmen in Jos on Wednesday said President Tinubu in less than one month in office has demonstrated to Nigerians that he has the capacity and political experience to provide the much needed quality and purposeful leadership that can take Nigeri­ans out of its present economic and security challenges. According to Bishop Katung, President Tinubu has performed creditably well to the expecta­tions of Nigerians and North­ern Pentecostal Bishops and Pastors. According to him, President Tinubu had already taken the bull by the horns with peo­ple-centred policies and actions that have touched the hearts of millions of Nigerians. Bishop Katung equally com­mended the appointment of the secretary to the federal govern­ment in the person of Senator George Akume a seasoned ad­ministrator from Benue State North central Nigeria and the likes of Nuhu Ribadu as Nation­al security Adviser (NSA) from Adamawa state North East Nige­ria and other appointments such as new security Chiefs that the President has made so far. “When we met President Tinubu in Abuja as a body of Northern Pentecostal Bishops in Abuja shortly before the 2023 Presidential election, Tinubu gave us his word on his readiness to provide purposeful leadership if he wins the presidential elec­tion, and having won the polls, he is now providing that much needed quality leadership to Ni­gerians.”
