GOMBE  – The Nigerian Youth Parlia­ment (NYP) has described the proposed plan to increase elec­tricity tariff by the Nigeria Elec­tricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) as an anti-masses move that is capable of getting Nige­rians into a deadlier hardship than what they are already facing. Speaking through their Speaker, Dr. Azeezat Yishawu, in a press statement, the Parlia­ment said, it will cause undue hardship to Nigerians coupled with the fact that many are still grappling with the oil subsidy removal. She said, just like the fuel subsidy removal, the increase in electricity tariff will have direct negative consequences on every person, business and other key sectors. According to her, the hike will further tip the socio-eco­nomic life of the majority of Ni­gerians to the edge, from small businesses to giant production companies, the Health sector, Education, and Agriculture, es­pecially in the processing and storage chain to mention a few. Dr. Yishawu who called for the distribution of more prepaid metres to underserved commu­nities said the increment will hit a heavier blow on everyday struggling and hard-working Nigerian youths. She explained “As of 2020, only about 50 per cent of Nige­rians have access to some sort of electricity and this does not mean adequate regular power supply.
