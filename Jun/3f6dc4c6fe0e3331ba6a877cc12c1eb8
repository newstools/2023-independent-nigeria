LAGOS – Payment Service Banks (PSBs) and fintechs in the country have been told to collaborate in the quest to ensure that the gains of financial inclusion are achieved. Speaking while delivering a keynote address at the 2023 Digital Pay Expo Conference and Exhibition on the topic: “Financial Inclusion and the New Customer Orientation,” the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of 9Payment Service Bank, Branka Mracajac, emphasised the need for collaboration among all the players to better serve the unbanked, underbaked, and the banked. She said: “There are over one million agents across Nigeria and none of them delivers any other products but payment transactions, cash in, cash out. This means that partnership is crucial for financial inclusion to happen in Nigeria. “I am hoping that all payment service banks, fintech and other players in the market will move the numbers when it comes to financial inclusion. The situation in 2020 as stated by EFInA proves that only one out of two Nigerians was using regulated financial services. We see those 21.3 million adult women, representing 20 per cent of Nigeria’s adult population and 17 million men, were yet to be included in the financial system. She said her company is committed to providing innovative, tailor-made financial products and services so as to improve the lifestyle of the underserved, and thereby reduce drastically the gap in the country between the banked, the underbaked and the unbanked. “At 9PSB, we meet the unique needs of our customers at preferred touchpoints by serving the rural and underdeveloped communities with little or no access to traditional banking infrastructure, through our wide agent network. Providing fundamental financial services preceded by localized financial literacy efforts, to individuals and small businesses lies at the core of our offerings,” she added.
