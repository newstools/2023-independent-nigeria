In a highly anticipated an­nouncement, the prestigious Anambra Man of the Year 2022 Award Committee has declared Cardinal Peter Okpaleke as the deserving recipient of this es­teemed recognition. Following a rigorous selection process, Cardinal Okpaleke’s ex­traordinary journey in Ahiara Diocese, particularly during his appointment as the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Ahiara, has captivated hearts and minds, so­lidifying his position as a symbol of humility and leadership. Born on March 1, 1963, as a twin in the household of Mr. Reuben and Bridget Ezeuko from Umuocha village, Amesi, Aguata L.G.A of Anambra State, Peter Okpaleke’s educational path led him to St. John Bosco Seminary in Isuaniocha and Bigard Memorial Seminary in Ikot-Ekpene, where he pursued his studies in theology. His dedication and commit­ment to his faith continued as he obtained his doctorate degree in Canon Law from the University of Della Santa Croce in Rome, Italy, while also acquiring a di­ploma in Ecclesiastical Admin­istration. The appointment of Fr. Peter Okpaleke as the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Ahiara by His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI on December 7, 2012, marked a significant turning point in his journey. However, the path ahead was not without challenges. Opposi­tion from certain members of the clergy within the diocese prevented Bishop Peter from assuming his rightful position and carrying out his episcopal duties. Despite these tribulations, Cardinal Okpaleke exhibited remarkable humility, patience, and love. His unwavering com­mitment to his vocation as a true priest was evident as he accepted his fate with grace and continued to pray for his persecutors and the Ahiara diocese. His stead­fast faith and unyielding spirit became an inspiring testament to humility and leadership. Recognising Cardinal Peter Okpaleke’s exceptional quali­ties, on March 5, 2020, the Pope announced the establishment of the Catholic Diocese of Ekwulo­bia and appointed him as its first Bishop. POLL Subsequently, acknowledging his remarkable leadership, the Pope elevated him to the cardi­nalate, an esteemed position as a Prince of the Church. Through­out the challenging times he faced, Cardinal Okpaleke’s de­meanor and conduct garnered widespread praise and admira­tion from various quarters. His Eminence epitomizes the essence and values that the Anambra Man of the Year Award represents. It is a tremen­dous honour for Cardinal Ok­paleke to be bestowed with this prestigious accolade, as he serves as an inspiration to society at large. His life, characterised by virtuous qualities and selfless altruism, shines as a guiding light for those who aspire to con­tribute meaningfully, persevere through adversity, and embody graciousness and honour.
