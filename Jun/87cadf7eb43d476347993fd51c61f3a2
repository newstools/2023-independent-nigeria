KANO – Immediate past governor of Kano state, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje on Friday commiserated with the victims of demolished Daula Hotel building in the state. In a statement signed by the former commissioner for Information and Internal Affairs, Kano State, Malam Muhammad Garba, the governor stated that the incident and the attendant death and injuries are regrettable and a huge loss to the state. He pray that Allah gives the family of the dead victim the fortitude to bear the loss and quick recovery for the injured. The governor said the victims were said to be scavengers scouting for irons or metals from the debris of the building demolished half away by the state government in a destruction spree of landed properties it embarked upon since its inception on May 29. Ganduje expressed regrets over the theft of properties by looters from several demolished buildings in different parts of the state capital. The statement also commiserated with property owners who legally acquired and developed for business and other purposes but were destroyed by the New Nigeria People’s Party government in the state without any form of investigation. It explained that the governor was of the view that since some of the owners have gone to the court to seek legal redress, he remained confident that justice would be served.
