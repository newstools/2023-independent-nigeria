LAGOS â€“ The Eze Ndigbo of Lagos State, Eze Christian Nwachukwu, has charged Igbo traders and others in the state to do due diligence before they buy land in order to avoid issues in the future. He gave the advice while speaking with Daily Independent about the attendant controversy that arose following the demolition of some structures by the Lagos State Task Force at the Alaba International Market last Friday. Nwachukwu, however, sympathized with the traders that lost their property and goods. He said that many people who are not landowners are always looking for people to sell land to and defraud, adding that anyone who wants to buy a piece of land in any part of the state to do due diligence and find out if it has some exuberances on it. The Igbo leader also urged anyone who wants to buy land in the state for whatever purpose to go to the Ministry of Lands and Housing and check if the government has acquired the land. The demolition, which was carried out by the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA), sparked outrage among traders in the market, who described the exercise as politically motivated and an attempt to force them out. The agency had brought down at least 17 buildings considered to be in distress for immediate demolition across the market. But Eze Nwachukwu stated that information at his disposal showed that the process that led to the demolition started in 2016 when the traders were given notices because their buildings were on the waterway and some had become defective and became a threat to life and property. POLL He added that the action of the agency was not politically or ethnically motivated as alleged in some quarters. Eze Nwachukwu called on the people not to engage in self-help, adding that there is need to maintain peace in the state. He called on Igbo traders Lagos State to engage in dialogue in order to resolve issues.
