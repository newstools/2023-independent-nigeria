The global SMS Firewall Market reached $2.24 billion in 2021 and is projected to exhibit a revenue CAGR of 10.5 per cent throughout the forecast period. The growth of A2P (Application-to-Person) messaging traffic, coupled with the increasing adoption of SMS firewalls for revenue generation and enhancing user experience, are anticipated to drive the market’s revenue growth. Additionally, the escalating demand for SMS firewalls among Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and the implementation of government regulations to safeguard user rights and information are expected to further support the market’s revenue growth. SMS firewalls serve as a protective technology for mobile networks and users against SMS-based attacks and cyber threats by providing comprehensive control and safeguarding all network messages. They encompass features such as SMS analysis and SMS home router. SMS analysis involves the examination and categorization of all on-net and off-net Signaling System 7 (SS7)-based messages, distinguishing between A2P and P2P messages to identify and block any potentially unauthorized routes. The home router function plays a crucial role in preserving user privacy, safeguarding their International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), and maintaining the confidentiality of their location. The increasing volume of A2P messaging traffic is expected to drive the revenue growth of the global SMS firewall market. A2P messaging refers to message traffic where individuals receive SMS from applications or software programs, rather than from other individuals. The utilization of SMS firewalls for revenue generation in A2P traffic is on the rise. This is achieved by detecting and blocking potential unauthorized routes, as well as channeling A2P traffic through official routes, thereby preventing revenue leakage. The growing demand for SMS firewalls to enhance user experience is also contributing to their adoption by various mobile network operators. By analyzing and categorizing all messages passing through the firewall, user safety is maximized, resulting in an enriched user experience. This increased adoption is driving the revenue growth of the market. The global SMS firewall market encompasses various factors and segments that contribute to its growth. In terms of SMS type, there are two significant categories: A2P (Application-to-Person) messaging and P2A (Person-to-Application) messaging. A2P messaging involves the transmission of messages from applications or software programs to individuals, whereas P2A messaging refers to messages sent by individuals to applications or software programs.
