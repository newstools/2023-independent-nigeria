The Independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)[1] has validated MTN Group’s company-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets – a significant milestone in our sustainability journey as well as an important recognition of our dedication to mitigating climate change. “Businesses have a key role to play in tackling climate change using the latest science,” says MTN Group Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer Nompilo Morafo. “We are pleased to be joining over 5 200 companies and financial institutions that are taking vital steps to help deliver rapid emissions reductions, working with the SBTi.” SBTi classified MTN’s scope 1 and 2 target ambition as being in line with climate science with a 1.5°C trajectory, an important recognition of the Company’s dedication to mitigating climate change and a significant milestone in MTN’s sustainability journey. MTN is committed to reducing absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 from a 2021 base year. We have also pledged to decrease absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from fuel and energy-related activities by 50% by 2030 from a 2021 base. “In collaboration with our suppliers, we are committed to ensuring that 80% of suppliers by spend will have science-based targets by 2026,” says MTN Group Chief Technology and Information Officer Mazen Mroué. “We believe in doing for our planet, and that’s why environmental and social considerations are at the heart of everything we do.” MTN’s SBTi-approved targets will be published on the SBTi website on 29 June 2023. Beyond our environmental commitments, MTN is driving digital inclusion and empowerment across Africa, embodying our dedication to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. By creating shared value for our stakeholders through environmental, social, governance and economic value-added business practices and solutions, MTN is not only creating a more sustainable business model but is also helping improve the lives of people in Africa.
