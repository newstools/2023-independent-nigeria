This year’s Ileya season promises to be a memorable one for the people of Epe and environ as the city will host veteran comedian Gbenga Adeyinka’s soar-away #LaffmattazzUnityTour on 29 June (a day after Ileya). The high octane comedy and music show, which will be held at Jubilee Chalets Epe, will parade popular entertainers like Small Doctor, Kolade Onanuga, Koffi Da Guru, Omo Baba, Bash, Dr Smile, MC Ajele and Mekoyo to mention a few, while DJ Vinnie will be on the wheel-of-steel. The Epe edition of Laffmattazz Unity Tour is tagged ‘Idan Gangan is coming’, a strong indication that it will be a mother of all shows. It is sponsored by Maltina, Goldberg and Ace Bitters, with support from Eleganza Industries. For close to two decades, Laffmattazz with Gbenga Adeyinka & Friends has been touring South West states in Nigeria. The show holds in at least five different states every year. Laffmattazz, which has been dubbed a laugh therapy for Nigerians, has consistently been sold out, with high profile performances from the country’s best entertainers.
