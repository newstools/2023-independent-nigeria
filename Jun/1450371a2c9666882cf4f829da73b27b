Liverpool are one of three Premier League clubs who want to sign Fulham defender Kenny Tete, according to reports. The Reds are looking to improve the depth of their squad after a disappointing season which saw them finish fifth in the Premier League and without a major trophy. Tete has provided one goal and five assists for Fulham with the Cottagers finishing tenth in a brilliant first season back in the top flight. And the Netherlands international is now attracting interest in England and abroad with The Sun claiming that Tete has ‘zoomed onto the radar of Liverpool and two other unnamed Premier League rivals as Fulham stall on a new deal’. It is also understood that ‘an unrevealed La Liga club are also interested’ in his services as the Dutchman prepares to enter the final 12 months of his contract at Craven Cottage, although Fulham have an option to extend his deal by another year. They suggest Tete is more likely to pick an English club this summer with the former Lyon man making it clear that the Premier League is where he wants to play. On joining Fulham, Tete said: “It is a great feeling. I feel blessed to be here. I heard of Fulham’s interest and I was bowled over. “I spoke with people around me and knew quickly I wanted to leave Lyon and join Fulham. POLL “The team is back in the Premier League now and I will give 100 per cent to keep us there.”
