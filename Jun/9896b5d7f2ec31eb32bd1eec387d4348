The Director General of Nigeria Employers Consultative Association (NECA) Mr Adewale-Smatt Oyerinde, has called on President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to involve the Organised Private Sector (OPS) in policy formulation in order to fast track economic growth. Oyerinde, while citing the contribution recorded by the private sector in the past in GDP, despite the odds, as reason for his call, reminded Mr President that if non-oil sector stood at N2.57 trillion in 2022 with a growth rate of growth of 19.6% for the whole year; share of oil export to total export was recorded at 76.74% in 2022, with share non-oil to total export stood at 9.54% in 2022, contribution of oil sector to GDP was 5.67% in 2022; and non-oil sector contribution to GDP was 94.33% in 2022, then the sector can play a major role in restoration of the economy in 2023. “While we note and commend President Tinubu for the bold steps he had taken so far, we look forward to the outcomes of the reform initiated so far. “The steps have been deliberate and bold, which is one of the missing ingredients in the last administration. A quick appointment of competent individuals to the various Ministries, Departments and Agencies will either affirm the repositioning or otherwise of the economy.” He urged the Federal Government to demonstrate its true commitment to national development by participation in the two days event. He noted that NECA is set for second annual employers’ summit with theme: Trade and Non-Oil Exports; Changing the Narratives, on 10th – 11th July, 2023 at Intercontinental Hotel (formerly Sheraton) as means of achieving its set goals for economic growth through inclusion of OPS in scheme of things
