The All Progressives Congress (APC) Professionals Council has felicitated with the Chief of Staff to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Femi Gbajabiamila and the Góvernór of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on their 61st and 58th birthdays respectively. The council said the two celebrants have distinguished themselves in excellent service delivery to the people of Lagos State and Nigerians at large. In a congratulatory message made available to journalists on Sunday, the National Director General of the council, Seyi Bamigbade, applauded the Chief of Staff for remaining a patriot, respected parliamentarian and committed public officer. He noted that Gbajabiamila stands as a model for inspiration among young Nigerians. Bamigbade also thanked Gbajabiamila for being a good ambassador of Surulere Federal Constituency that he represented in the House of Representatives for 20 years, as one of the longest-serving federal lawmakers in the country. He thanked for former Speaker of the House of Representatives for the stability he brought in the Green Chamber during his tenure in the 9th House Of Reps. While congratulating Governor Sanwo-Olu on his 58th birthday, Bamigbade thanked him for redefining governance in Lagos in the past four years, a feat he said, earned the governor another four years following his victory at the polls in March 18 governorship election. He further described Sanwo-Olu as embodiment of humility and excellence, who has carved a niche for himself as an outstanding public servant. POLL He prayed God to strengthen the two celebrants as they continue to contribute their quota in raising the country’s bar of development even higher.
