Pfizer has re-launched Eliquis, an anticoagulant, to address the gradual increase in the preva­lence of stroke due to a heart condition called atrial fibrilla­tion in Nigeria. This condition is a major concern, being a common cause of death in the adult pop­ulation. Olayinka Subair, Cluster Lead West Africa at Pfizer, while speaking at the re-launch, said with hyperten­sion as the number one heart disease affecting not less than 10 million adults in Nigeria and only about one-third are on effective treatment and the number of diagnoses contin­ues to rise, there was the need for effective treatment. He said new treatment strat­egies were urgently needed to improve the treatment success rate of severe and critically-ill patients. “For more than 150 years globally, Pfizer has been a lead­er in tackling some of the most persistent healthcare challeng­es through the breakthrough medicines and vaccines we discover, develop and bring to market. “Our medical break­throughs change people’s lives as we focus on the areas of greatest need, tackling the dis­eases that present the biggest challenge across countries and regions.” While advocacy on the management of heart con­ditions like atrial fibrillation and blood glucose level are gaining ground, according to him, there was still a lot to be done to create necessary aware­ness among patients and prac­titioners because knowledge and experience have shown that complications from heart conditions are preventable and reversible when identified early. Professor Amam Chinyere Mbakwem, Professor of Med­icine, consultant physician and cardiologist, College of Medicine, University of Lagos, while delivering her keynote address titled ‘Unmet Needs in Stroke Prevention for High Risk Patients with NVAF – Ni­geria Perspective’, stated that “Eliquis is an anticoagulant used in adults to prevent a blood clot from forming in the heart in patients with an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation), ve­nous thromboembolism (VTE) and at least one additional risk factor.
