BIRNIN KEBBI  – A non-governmental organiza­tion, Almajiri Support Initiative in Kebbi State, has described the presidential assent on Almaji Commission by former president Muhammadu Buhari as timely and a good step towards getting rid of almajiri street begging. According to the chairman of the NGO, Comrade Shehu Umar, expressed the fear that the commission may not take care of genuine almajiris, saying doing so would defeat the prima­ry purpose and function of the body which seeks to take beggars across the country off the streets. Umar stated that he is current­ly running an almajiri support programme in the past 20 years and has trained and graduated at least 10,000 categories of almaji­ris who are now fully integrated into society, practising their cho­sen trades like welding, tailoring, shoe making and driving.
