Residents of the Akure metropolis and other towns and villages in Ondo State affected by flooding from Friday night till Saturday evening have been assured of quick intervention to avert a recurrence of the incident. Giving the assurance on Sunday, the Acting Governor, Hon. Lucky Aiyedatiwa, said proper clearing of all waterways and canals in all the affected areas would be carried out earnestly to check flooding in the state. Aiyedatiwa,who visited all the locations affected by flooding in the capital city after an all night downpour, observed that the incident happened mostly as a result of blockage of waterways and canals by refuse, silt and weeds. The 17-hour rainfall led to heavy flooding that overran the banks of the waterways and canals, getting many trapped in their home and outside. Many structures and property were destroyed and washed away by flood within the period it lasted. Aiyedatiwa, therefore, appealed to the residents to desist from improper disposal of waste which blocked the Ala River which affected most areas in the metropolis. Among areas affected by flooding are structures along Ala River in Leo, Ayedun, Odo-Ikoyi, Isolo, Araromi, Irese in Akure South and Ifedore local government areas. The Acting Governor disclosed that the state government had released counterpart funds to partner relevant agencies to clear and expand canals and waterways in the state to avoid flood incident in the future. POLL He said: “We want to appeal to residents to desist from throwing waste into drainages. This act causes hindrance in water flow thus makes it difficult. “Please, you have to cooperate with the environmental officers and pay your dues adequately for them to come and pack your wastes. “The government of Ondo State has released counterpart funds to partner with other relevant agencies to expand the waterways for easy flow of water. “I want to assure you that there will be prompt intervention to clear the water channels for easy movement of water.”
