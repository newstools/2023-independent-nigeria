ABUJA – The Senate on Tuesday ap­proved a list of 20 special ad­visers forwarded to it by Pres­ident Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The request was read on the floor of the upper chamber of the National Assembly by Sen­ate President Ahmad Lawan. The request, however, did not feature specific names of the proposed appointees, even as the letter received a speedy nod from the Senate under an “utmost urgency” clause. In his remarks, Lawan said it is of “utmost urgency” that the president has his team to work with. “Because there is no name for special advisers we will just approve it from here. We feel that this is something of utmost ur­gency,” the Senate President said. The development came days after Tinubu an­nounced the appointment of Femi Gbajabiamila, out­going speaker of the House of Representatives, as his Chief of Staff, and George Akume, former Minister of Special Duties as the Secre­tary to the Government of the Federation (SGF).
