Zlatan Ibrahimovic has announced his immediate retirement from football. The 41-year-old has ended his playing career with AC Milan and has opted to hang up his boots once his contract with the Italian club expires at the end of the month. During his 24-year career which began with Swedish side Malmo in 1999, Ibrahimovic scored 511 goals and won 32 trophies, including league titles in the Netherlands, Spain, France and Italy with both Inter and AC Milan. At Manchester United, Ibrahimovic helped the club win the EFL Cup and the Europa League in 2017 but his time at Old Trafford was cut short due to a severe cruciate ligament injury. Remarkably, Ibrahimovic was able to recover from his knee injury and spent the next 21 months at LA Galaxy before he returned to Italy for a second stint at AC Milan where he helped the club claim their first Serie A title in 11 years last season. At an international level, Ibrahimovic was capped 122 times by Sweden and is their all-time leading scorer with 62 goals. In his speech at San Siro on Sunday evening, Ibrahimovic said: ‘So many memories and emotions inside this stadium. ‘The first time I arrived you gave me happiness, the second time, you gave me love. I want to thank my family and those close to me for their patience. I want to thank my second family. The players, the coach and his staff for the responsibility they gave me. I want to thank the directors for the opportunity they gave me. POLL SOURCE: (Metro.co.uk)
