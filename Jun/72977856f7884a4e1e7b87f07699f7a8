The 20-year-old, whose father is co-owner of Inter Miami, spent the second half of last season on loan with Brentford B. Beckham helped them lift the Premier League Cup last season, featuring 15 times, while also scoring against National League side Wealdstone in the Middlesex Senior Cup. Brentford B head coach Neil MacFarlane hopes the youngster can continue his development in west London. “We added Romeo to our squad in January and he’s been fantastic for the group,” he said. “He’s had a terrific end to the season in terms of his recent match against Manchester City where he showed what he’s learned during his loan with us. We’ve continued to develop him in and out of possession and we look forward to him coming back in good spirits to continue working with him next season.” David Beckham played for Manchester United, Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, AC Milan, Paris Saint-Germain and England in a iconic career before retiring in 2013. Beckham’s Inter Miami recently announced the signing of Lionel Messi after the Argentina legend left Paris Saint-Germain.
