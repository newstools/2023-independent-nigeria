LAGOS – Business mogul and philanthropist, Chief Emeka Agba, the Odagbulu Ihe Dagbulu Ihe Dagbulu Enyi I of Igboland, has called on President Bola Tinubu to implement policies and programmes that will reduce the negative impact of the removal of subsidy. Speaking with Daily Independent in Lagos on Friday, Agba, who is also the President of Emeka Agba Foundation, said that the President did the right thing by removing the subsidy on petrol, because, according to him, it was increasing the debt profile and impacting the Nigerian economy negatively. However, he stated that the President should implement programmes and policies that “will prevent the removal subsidy on petrol from crippling the way of life of Nigerians at the lower end of the economic ladder.” The Lagos-based philanthropist also called on the President to increase the minimum wage of workers so that they can be able to have a decent income. He argued that an improved minimum will allow workers to have a decent life. He urged Tinubu to provide good leadership to Nigerians, adding that Nigerians will support the President if he leads them in the right direction. According to him, “Life is about passion; Tinubu has a passion for life and the good things of life. I believe that he will bring good things to a majority of Nigerians. “You cannot give what you do not have; Tinubu has the capacity to deliver on the promises that he made to Nigerians and I am saying this because of his antecedents and what he did when he was the governor of Lagos State.” Agba called on Organized Labour to find a middle ground with the Federal Government through negotiations. POLL He called on the President to improve the security situation in the country so that farmers can go to the farms without fear.
