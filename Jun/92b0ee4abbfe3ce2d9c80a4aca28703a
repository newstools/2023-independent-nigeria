A chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC), Femi Fani-Kayode has reported an alleged unlawful search of the residence of the former governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle, by police officers. According to him, the officers were looking for cars without possession of an arrest or search warrant. Fani-Kayode strongly condemned the action, suggesting it was a vindictive move allegedly instigated by Matawalle’s successor. The former Aviation Minister via his Twitter handle shared photographs of the incident and wrote, “This morning a detachment of policemen raided the home of my brother, the former Gov. of Zamfara state, Bello Matawalle in Maradun. They claimed to be looking for cars. “They did not have a search or arrest warrant and they claimed to be acting on the orders of the new Governor. This is unacceptable. It is not only vindictive but also lawless and it stands condemned.”[14:23, 09/06/2023] Mr Ajiboye INL: Go.
