AWKA â€“ The immediate past 7th legislature of Anambra State at its final plenary on June 8th bestowed an award of meritorious service on the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) Hon. Amalachukwu Kenneth Anazodo. Anazodo who represented the Nnewi-North state constituency in the 6th assembly and who was equally the Special Adviser to ex-Governor Willie Obiano on National and State Assembly Matters, told our correspondent shortly after his grand recognition that he was full of gratitude for having been found worthy to be recognized and celebrated by his peers in the legislature. He said the most important honour one could receive was the honour given to him by his peers, adding that he was indeed very appreciative of the honour bestowed on him by the 7th legislature. Anazodo who disclosed further that the few years he worked with members of the 7th assembly on an advisory basis to the Government of Anambra State, revealed that lawmakers of the just concluded 7th legislature were a bunch of very peaceful individuals who ran a rancour-free legislature. He, therefore, observed that there was never any incidence of impeachments which he said was very remarkable and commendable. Although he pointed out that legislative affairs is a continuous process, he expressed the belief that the incoming 8th assembly will do better than the outgone 7th assembly. He said also that the 7th assembly was not a rubber stamp instead a democratic and very tranquil atmosphere existed for cross-pollination as well as cross-fertilisation of ideas for the betterment of Ndi-Anambra.
