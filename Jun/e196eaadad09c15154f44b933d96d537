Kebbi Chairman of the National Association of Nigerian Nurses and Midwives, Kelani Abdulwaliyu, has described as timely the victory and subsequent inauguration of Dr Nasir Idris Kauran Gwandu as the new governor of Kebbi State. According to him, NANNM was not surprised that Idris won elections because of his doggedness as demonstrated when he served NUT and NLC even to the rank of National President of NUT and the feat he achieved can traced to his hard work, justice and fairness to all his members at that time. Comrade Waliyu added that the union is optimistic that as a unionist who knows how to struggle and knows the problems of nurses which, among other things, include mass exodus of nurses to other higher health facilities due to poor remuneration. Secondly, nurses are in short supply amounting to the manpower shortage in the state health facilities. “We are very sure nurses in Kebbi would have reason to smile because we believe he would end the nurses’ exodus and as well improve their welfare to discourage them from leaving the state services he said. He urged nurses in Kebbi state to massively throw their weight behind his government as he brings an aggressive change in the Kebbi State health sector and many other sectors in the state.
