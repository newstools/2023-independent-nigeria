A group known as the South-West Frontiers has expressed worry over the concerns that a section of those who call themselves supporters of the President Bola Tinubu is scheming the illegal arrest of some prominent aspirants for the House of Representatives Speaker and the Senate Presidency such as the former Zamfara Governor, Abdulaziz Yari who is seeking the Senate President position. A statement on Sunday signed by the Frontiers Chairman, Kolawale Adediji Kazeem, described the move as provocative, unwarranted and unsolicited attempt to paint the Tinubu Presidency in bad light and cause rifts between the Northern political allies of the South-West. “We observe the deliberate attempt by some desperate politicians to drag the President into their self-serving battle by making it appear like his own war, which in reality, is not. “For the avoidance of doubt, the South-West would not tolerate any move for the sake of some few people’s ego, that would drag the South-West presidency into collision with any of its friends, especially the North. “We therefore warn all those who see it as their duty to cause rifts between our president, a universally renowned cosmopolitan democrat into the dirty mud of their dubious agenda to desist as we are amply ready to protect our President at any cost. “To our dear President, we restate confidence in his ability and capacity to cope with whichever leadership the legislature presents for the good of the country. “We therefore call on him to beware of bad company around him and to resist any temptation to get him to act outside the Constitution. “While calling on the President to allow due process of democracy to take its course in the emergence of the leadership of the National Assembly, we urge all aspirants not to give in to intimidation or blackmail.”
