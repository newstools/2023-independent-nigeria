The leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State on Thursday gave kudosto President Bola Tinubu’s 30 days old administration for its decision to remove subsidies from Petrol and free-float the Naira currency. According to the party, “The two economic policies were spot on. And it’s the best way to go around the economy that has been grounded for some years. Dr. Tony Aziegbemi, Chairman of the Edo State chapter of the party who, disclosed this during an interactive session with journalists in Benin City, also said those two economic policies alone would give the country in excess of N2 trillion. The PDP chairman, however, cautioned that the palliatives that would be ditched out-arising from the subsidies removal would determine the success of the economic policies, adding, “because I know the average Nigerian is hit”. On why he is commending an opposition-led federal government, Aziegbemi said: “It’s the paradigm shift in policies that we are bringing onboard in the PDP. “I am an economist. So, when I see good economic policies from a distance, I will know”. In the same vein, the Edo PDP chairman commended Governor Godwin Obaseki administration in Edo State for delivering on its promises to the people. He listed some of the people-oriented programmes of the administration including Education reforms, health and technology hub where youths are trained on soft wares engineering. POLL According to him, “in the next five years, we are going to have 15,000 trained software engineers that would generate programmes for companies like Google and others”.
