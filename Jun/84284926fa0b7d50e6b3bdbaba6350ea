ABUJA – As the debate for equitable leadership in the National Assembly continues, a group, APC Renaissance Group, has called on the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), to consider healing and reconciliation of Nigerians first, in selecting principal officers at the legislature. The group, in a statement on Thursday by its National Coordinator, Jideoffor Chebe, and Secretary, Tajudeen Gbadamosi, wondered why the party is insensitive to the clamour for national healing “of a country that is sharply divided along obvious ethnic and regional fault lines”. It said that after four years of enduring an “administration whose choices were at variance with the hopes and aspirations of the people; a government whose appointments and selections did not consider the ethnic and regional diversity of Nigeria, our party should not be quick again to repeat such feats. The current selection where the Northwest is asked to be the Deputy Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives is like continuing the Buhari era. “Or should we wonder if our great party has adopted a script of marginalization of other regions and ethnic groups to feed the parochial interest of a few. “The present situation needs to be quickly addressed so that every part of the country will have a sense of identity in Nigeria. Otherwise, what is there to tell anyone from the north central which has contributed immensely to President Bola Tinubu’s victory, that His Excellency values loyalty to the party? We urge the National Working Committee (NWC) to do the needful, and correct a mistake already made before it becomes our national culture, as this will breed resentment, kill patriotic zeal in country men and women, as well as create a system of thinking where people wait for their turn to take their bounds of flesh”, it added. This is as it expressed confidence in the Tinubu led administration to bring the much needed national healing that the country so desires.
