LAGOS – Napoli striker Victor Osimhen has arrived in the Super Eagles camp ahead of Nigeria’s crucial Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier against the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone. Alongside Senegal and Bayern Munich forward Sadio Mane, Osimhen is the leading goalscorer during the AFCON qualification series with five goals. Osimhen’s arrival brings the number of players in the Super Eagles’ Lagos camp to 22. Head coach Jose Peseiro last week rolled out a 23-man roster for the matchday five clash against Sierra Leone. Victor Osimhen will be expected to lead the line for the Super Eagles against the Leone Stars in Monrovia on Sunday, June 18. A win in that encounter will hand the three-time African champions a qualifying ticket to the next edition of the continental championship in Ivory Coast next year with a game to spare. Already in camp for the game are Vice-captain William Troost-Ekong, Atalanta’s Ademola Lookman, Southampton’s Joe Aribo, and Everton’s Alex Iwobi. Also in are the defensive trio of Ajax’s Calvin Bassey, West Brom’s Semi Ajayi, and Hoffenheim’s Kevin Akpoguma.Peseiro has also welcomed the Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) quartet of Ebube Duru, Victor Sochima, Olorunleke Ojo, and Divine Nwachukwu. Leganes defender Kenneth Omeruo, Leicester City’s dynamic duo of Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho, Nottingham Forest striker Taiwo Awoniyi, Nantes’ Moses Simon, Hapoel Jerusalem’s Adebayo Adeleye, Brentford’s Frank Onyeka, and Fenerbahce’s Bright Osayi-Samuel have all landed in camp. POLL FC Porto’s marauding full-back Zaidu Sanusi and Super Eagles captain Ahmed Musa are among the latest to join their international teammates in Lagos.
