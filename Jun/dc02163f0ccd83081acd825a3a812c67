AKURE  – Ondo State government has put up more efforts in ensuring the application of contents of the Violence Against Persons Prohi­bition (VAPP) Law in the state as all stakeholders gathered on Tuesday in Akure, the state capital, to synergize on eradication of gender violence in the state. Leading the gathering, tagged: “Enhancement of the capacity of state institutions for effective implementation of laws to promote inclusion, gender equality and reverse GBV,” the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Charles Titiloye, charged the sponsors of the law, Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD) and Ondo State Agency Against Gender-Based Violence (OSAA-GBV), to work with the security agencies in the state, particularly the Police, to ensure suspects of gender violence are prosecuted with VAPP Law. He noted that the Police College has not included the VAPP Law in its curriculum, whereby the Police officers are only aware of the exist­ing Criminal Code and Child Rights Law, which they use to prepare charges against suspects. The Attorney General, therefore, charged WFD and OSAA-GBV to work with the law enforcement agencies and acquaint them with the new law on gender violence so as to make use of this in prose­cuting suspects. He said: “It is important to note that the relevant security agencies that would make use of the VAPP Law, which is the new gender violence law, are not awareof theexistenceof thelaw. “Up till now, they still make use of the existing Criminal Code and Child Rights laws. Even in the Police College, the VAPP Law is taught there. So, the Police officers are only aware of the existing laws.’
