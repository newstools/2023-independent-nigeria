Mouka, one of Nigeria’s lead­ing brands of mattresses, pillows, and other sleep prod­ucts, has bolstered its trade re­lations by taking 50 Business Partners on an exotic trip to Morocco in May 2023. At the recent trade confer­ence hosted by the company at the Lagos Intercontinen­tal Hotel, Victoria Island, Mouka’s Chief Commercial Officer, Dimeji Osingunwa, unveiled the ‘World of Com­fort Trip Promotion’ to its Business Partners. The promotion ran for four months, with 50 part­ners emerging as winners. 40 (forty) qualified for a trip to Morocco, while 10(ten) achieved the threshold for a trip to Brazil. Speaking on the reward scheme, Mr Osinguwa had this to say. “At Mouka, we see our trade partners as a part of the Mouka family. We have and continue to in­vest significantly in ensur­ing the relationship remains mutually beneficial for both parties. We have previously rewarded our partners with scholarships for their chil­dren, health packages, logis­tics trucks, tricycles, high-end electronics and many more benefits. This time we thought to ourselves, our partners need a break away from the hustle and bustle of Nigeria. They need to un­wind and re-energise them­selves in preparation for the work to come. As you know, good rest is required to safe­guard one’s wellbeing”. When asked about the choice of locations, Mouka’s CCO shared the rationale. Ac­cording to him, Morocco was picked for two reasons. First, Marrakesh is one of the most recommended tourist destina­tions, famous for its palaces, 5-star restaurants, luxury spas, charming riads (tradi­tional houses) and enchanting gardens. Secondly, Morocco is the headquarters for the Dolidol International group, Mouka’s parent company.
