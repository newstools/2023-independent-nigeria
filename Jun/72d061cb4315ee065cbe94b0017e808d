The Portuguese coach was fuming after losing his first European Final as a coach and may want to forget the game at the Puskas Arena soon. It’s probably no coincidence that the Special One didn’t keep his runners-up medal and threw it into the crowd seconds after receiving it. It was caught by a young fan in the main stand. Mourinho was furious after the final whistle. He openly blamed the referee Anthony Taylor during his post-match interviews and waited for the English official in the car park to continue insulting him.
