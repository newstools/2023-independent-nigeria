ABAKALIKI – Governor Francis Ogbonna Nwifuru of Ebonyi State has noted that no one or group could stampede him into making hasty political ap­pointments, saying that he is taking his time to assemble professionals in various areas to help him drive his policies and programmes. Nwifuru was reacting to a statement credited to the Association of Ebonyi Indi­genes Socio-Cultural in Dias­pora (AEISCID), which urged him to take firm control of the governance of Ebonyi State or resign, hinging their call on the ground that the governor has not appointed his kitchen cabinets days after assuming office. The group also alleged that the immediate past gov­ernor, David Umahi, was still in charge of the affairs of the state, not the incumbent gov­ernor. But Nwifuru in a state­ment signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Dr. Monday Uzor, berated AEISCID for what he described as their futile attempt to distract his administration, that is just few days old. The governor maintained that he was fully in charge of his administration, contrary to the claim of the group. According to him, the ap­pointment of ‘kitchen cabinet’ as contained in their diatribe remains the prerogative of the State Chief Executive and has nothing to do with performance. He also restated that no group or elements could cause disaffection between him and his predecessor, and warned those fanning such embers to desist. The statement reads: “The attention of the Governor of Ebonyi State, Francis Ogbon­na Nwifuru, has been drawn to a cheap and malicious statement allegedly credit­ed to an amorphous group, AEISCID, that struggled to descend on the arena of in­famy. POLL “Without condescending to the level of the said group, it is pertinent to note that the issues raised in the so-called press release and whatever they sought to achieve came dead on arrival as the gover­nor will not be distracted by their naked dance.”
