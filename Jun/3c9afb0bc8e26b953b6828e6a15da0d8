LAGOS  – The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit against Pres­ident Bola Ahmed Tinubu over failure to probe the allegations that $2.1 billion and N3.1 trillion public funds of oil revenues and budgeted as fuel subsidy payment are missing and unaccounted for between 2016 and 2019. The suit followed the grim alle­gations documented by the Audi­tor-General of the Federation in the 2016 and 2019 annual reports that the public funds are missing. In the suit number FHC/L/CS/1107/23 filed last Friday at the Federal High Court in Lagos, SERAP is seeking: “an order of mandamus to direct and compel President Tinubu to promptly probe allegations that $2.1 billion and N3.1 trillion public funds are missing and un­accounted for between 2016 and 2019.” The organisation is also seeking “an order of man­damus to compel President Tinubu to direct the an­ti-corruption agencies to promptly probe fuel subsi­dy payments made by gov­ernments since the return of democracy in 1999, name and shame and prosecute suspected perpetrators, and to recover any proceeds of crimes. “An order of mandamus to direct and compel Presi­dent Tinubu to use any re­covered proceeds of crime as palliatives to address the im­pact of the subsidy removal on poor Nigerians, and to put in place mechanisms for transparency and account­ability in the oil sector.” In the suit, SERAP is ar­guing that “the allegations that $2.1 billion and N3.1 trillion of public funds are missing and unaccounted amount to a fundamental breach of national anti­corruption laws and the country’s international ob­ligations including under the UN Convention against Corruption to which Nige­ria is a state party.” It is also arguing that “the Tinubu government has constitutional and in­ternational legal obliga­tions to get to the bottom of these allegations and ensure accountability for these se­rious crimes against the Nigerian people.” According to SERAP, “Directing and compel­ling President Tinubu to promptly probe, name and shame and bring to justice the perpetrators and to re­cover any missing public funds would advance the right of Nigerians to resti­tution, compensation and guarantee of non-repeti­tion. POLL “Allegations of corrup­tion in fuel subsidy pay­ments suggest that the poor have rarely benefited from the use and management of the payments.” The suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers, Kolawole Oluwadare, Ms. Adelanke Aremo, Ms. Valen­tina Adegoke, and Ayomide Johnson, also read in part: “There will be no econom­ic growth or sustainability without accountability for the human rights crimes. “Poor and socio-econom­ically vulnerable Nigerians should not be made to contin­ue to pay the price for the steal­ing of the country’s oil wealth while state and non-state ac­tors pocket public funds. “Investigating and pros­ecuting the allegations, and recovering any missing public funds would serve the public interest, ensure justice and accountability, and end the entrenched im­punity of perpetrators. “According to the audit­ed reports between 2016 and 2019 by the Auditor General of the Federation (AGF), the Nigerian Na­tional Petroleum Corpora­tion (NNPC) failed to remit N663,896,567,227.58 into the Federation Account. The Auditor-General fears that the money may be missing. “The NNPC also report­edly failed to account for the allocation of crude oil to refineries in 2019. 107,239,436.00 barrels of crude oil were lifted as do­mestic crude without any document. The Auditor-Gen­eral fears that the crude valued at N55,891,009,960.63 may have been diverted. “The NNPC in 2019 also failed to remit N1,955,354,671,268.66 and N55,157,702,848.74 of gen­erated revenues into the Federation Account, con­trary to Section 162(1) of the Nigerian constitution 1999 (as amended). The Auditor-General fears that the money may have been diverted. “The NNPC also failed to account for N4,572,844,962.25 of ‘domestic gas receipts’, thereby ‘reducing the dis­tributable revenue in the Federation Account.’ The NNPC also in 2019 failed to account for 22,929.84 li­tres of PMS pumped from refineries and valued at N7,056,137,180.00. “The NNPC also ‘illegal­ly classified’ 239,800 bar­rels of crude oil valued at N5,498,045,220 as ‘crude oil losses.’” No date has, however, been fixed for the hearing of the suit.
