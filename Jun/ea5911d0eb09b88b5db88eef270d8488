The General Overseer of Kaduna-based Throneroom Ministry, Apostle Emmanuel Kure, has resigned his appointment as a member and Co-Chairman of the Kaduna State Peace Commission (KSPC). His resignation, according to him, was based on the recent viral video where former governor of the state, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, was reportedly boasting over perceived Islamic domination in the state. The cleric, in a letter dated June 8, 2023 made available to newsmen and addressed to the commission, said the reported confession of Mallam El-Rufai on a plan to perpetuate Islamic domination in the state was contrary to his belief and fairness which his faith teaches and what he thought the Peace Commission stood for. Notifying the commission of his resignation, Kure said, “It was clear we were set up to serve a diversionary interest and that we were not meant to succeed. “This may explain why the governor never executed some of the suggestions from several of our parleys with him.” Apostle Kure stated further that he could not in good conscience serve a committee that would promote disharmony and the further disintegration of the country. He noted in the letter that El-Rufai proscribed the Attyap Development Association to send a warning to other associations in Southern Kaduna that try to project the plight of those in the region to the world. Kure prayed that the current government would do things to heal the wounds that the grave statement of the former governor had done to the psyche of the southern Kaduna people. POLL He also prayed that the Federal Government would find “a way of discountenancing his views to maintain peace and mutual trust between the religions in the country.”
