Borussia Dortmund are interested in signing Manchester United starlet Hannibal Mejbri as a replacement for Jude Bellingham, according to a new report. Bellingham is expected to depart Signal Iduna Park this summer to join Real Madrid, although German outlet kicker claim that Dortmund will stand firm and demand a base fee of â‚¬120 million to allow the 19-year-old to leave. But Real are in pole position to secure his signature, with Sky Sports claiming a deal would be a record transfer fee paid for an English footballer. Should Bellingham leave Dortmund, the German club would have to source his replacement. They have utilised the English market on several occasions over recent years, signing Jadon Sancho, Jayden Braaf and Jamie Bynoe-Gittens from the academy of Manchester City.
