Nollywood actor, Ibrahim Suleiman has paid tribute to his late mother, seven years after she passed on. In an Instagram post, the actor shared a photograph of himself at two with his mum. Captioning the photo, the ‘Up North’ actor said that he didn’t think he would make it past seven days after her demise. “But you always knew I was capable of things I was sure I wasn’t. And so here we are. Seven years of understanding a little better each day, why and how you made the sacrifices you did while raising your Three Musketeers. Now I understand why you insisted on making sure I never blamed anyone for anything or held grudges or bottled up feelings. “As the first #sonOfAisha, my mission is to make sure your impact lives even beyond me. Time hasn’t numbed the pain much, but I’ve built up tolerance for missing you. I miss your voice. Maybe more than anything else, because you always spoke with humour, wisdom, warmth and faith. Things that today’s world faces a huge deficiency in. “Keon is almost 3. He is such a warm, playful, compassionate, friendly and intelligent person. He reminds me of you. I hope Ihuoma and I are making you proud by the way we are raising him. Would have been nice to get a few tips from you, but we move,” he wrote. Sulaiman is married to Nollywood actress, Linda Ejiofor. In November, 2018, the couple had their traditional and white wedding days apart. The ceremony was attended by only the families, close friends and colleagues of the couple including Adesua Etomi, who functioned as the bridesmaid to Linda. The couple welcomed their first child, Keon in July, 2020.
