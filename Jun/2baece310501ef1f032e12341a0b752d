Management of Ilorin Avi­ation College (IAC) has com­mended Governor Abdul­Rahman AbdulRazaq for his continuous support for the school, saying that the contin­uous payment of the subven­tion and moral support have kept the school going. Acting Rector of the Col­lege, Captain Yakubu Okata­hi, said during the governor’s visit to the school on Tuesday evening, that the governor’s re­cent release of N75m enabled the college to purchase new aircraft engine and propeller, 10,000 litres of Jet-A1, and re­pair of the College’s fuel dump, among other things. Okatahi and other officers of the school also commended the governor for paying sub­vention, which helps to run the school, adding that the College management looks forward to increase in the fi­nancial support to cater for review of wages and some other things. Registrar of the College, Mohammed Jimada Jibril, commended the governor for his continuous assistance to the school, congratulating him on his re-election and emergence as the chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Fo­rum (NGF). The governor, who decorat­ed some of the graduates of the school, urged the College to avoid a repeat of the mis­management that set back the progress of the institution, in­cluding the withdrawal of the Nigerian Navy and misuse of over N300m funds of the Nige­rian Air Force. “With effective manage­ment, I believe Aviation Col­lege can attain autonomy and self-sufficiency in terms of funding. Our aim for the school is to achieve this, in­stead of relying on subvention from the government,” he said. In March, the Aviation College got the approval of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to increase the number of students after the regulatory body removed the initial limitations placed on the school — a feat attribut­able to the remarkable inter­ventions and support of the AbdulRazaq-led administra­tion.
