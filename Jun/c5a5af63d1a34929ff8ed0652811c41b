LAGOS – Governor Caleb Mutf­wang of Plateau State has alleged that what is happening in his state is a deliberate attack aimed at wip­ing out the people. The governor, while in an in­terview monitored by DAILY INDEPENDENT dismissed the insinuation in some quarters that the crisis on the Plateau is about a crisis involving farmers and herders, noting that such a position holds no water. He regretted that while peo­ple were asleep, the invaders at­tacked and killed them in their numbers, saying it was an orches­trated attack aimed at wiping out the people. The governor said: “Whatever it is, a lot of criminality has come into play and what we are seeing is a clear genocide; what we are seeing is a deliberated and orches­trated plan to wipe out numbers of people. I want to thank the se­curity forces because to a large extent they have done a lot, but I want to say that they can still do more with the right kind of em­pathy, with the right kind of mo­bilization, they can do a lot better. “Of course the tradition is that this is the farmers/herders clash but that is not the reality. Again this is a situation whereby people are sleeping in their villages and in the night they are attacked. The question needs to be asked which we are asking; who are the people behind these attacks, where are they coming from, who signed for them and who are the ring leaders behind this insurgency? “There is a lot of intelligence coming up which we are putting at the disposal of the security agencies and we are confident that with the change of guard of security arrangements in the country, I believe that we will be able to get some mileage in put­ting this ugly phase behind us,” he said. Meanwhile, more than 200 Per­sian have lost their lives on the Plateau in the last two weeks, this lending weight to the governor’s position.
