LAGOS  – Doxa Vision Project, a non-government organization, has urged governments at all levels to accord greater priority to the issue of women empowerment as a strategic means for tackling mass poverty in the country. Gloria Ojunta, President of the foundation, while speaking at a two-day skills acquisition and empowerment programme in Lagos stated that though several organisations such hers have been doing a lot in the areas of empowering vulnerable segments Aof the society, particularly the women, but that the government should also join the gesture and do more for the people. She said that the call became pertinent considering the role women play in the family which she stated is the micro unit of the society and that when they (women) are sufficiently empowered; poverty will be greatly reduced in the country. “Private and religious organisations such as ours have been doing a lot to empower the vulnerable segments of the society especially targeting the women who are exceptional managers of the home front. They also bear the effects of crises within the community. “Haven’t done much in this regard and considering the limited resources available to the government, I am appealing to the government at all levels to make this a priority,” she stated. According to her, such interventions will further scale up efforts in that direction as more women would not only be trained in vocational skills that would guarantee their livelihood, it would also empower them sufficiently, economically to effectively cater for the needs of the family, which she described as the bedrock of the society On her path, the Guest Speaker at the event, Pastor Efy Okonkwo harped more on the virtues of women who she described as the giver of life whose welfare and wellbeing must be protected and safeguarded at all times. Okonkwo, who is a former national executive member of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) urged women to always be cognizant of their place with man and God and to always exhibit Godly attributes at all times in their dealings with those they come across.
