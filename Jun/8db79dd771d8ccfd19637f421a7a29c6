…As Orji Cries Out Against Unfair Treatment The Vice President, Kashim Shettima has cautioned the lawmakers-elect to note that the stability of this nation is superior to the stability of their pockets. This is even as the Senate chief whip, Orji Uzo Kalu decried the unfair treatment against him despite his contribution to nation-building. The duo spoke during the valedictory session of the 9th Assembly held at the National Assembly. Shettima, who was a member of the 9th National Assembly but is now Vice President said, “As we bid farewell to this chapter, let us remember that our journey has just begun. For some of us, a new chapter beckons. As the mantle of leadership passes into fresh hands, those who will continue this noble calling, I extend my sincere congratulations. “To my colleagues who will depart this chamber, I address you not as colleagues left behind, but as friends who have become an integral part of my history. “We have served shoulder to shoulder in the face of adversity and worked relentlessly for the betterment of our nation. “To my incoming colleagues, I will leave you with a parable, ‘the stability of this nation is superior to the stability of our pockets’. On Tuesday, let us vote wisely, let us vote for the Nigerian nation.” POLL On his part, Orji said: “Before I came into politics, I could buy anything money can buy. I’m not a thief. Those that put me in prison know the reason. They took over my businesses and wanted to kill me yet I survived it and I’m in the senate with you. “I have never lacked, while I was in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) where I served for two terms as governor, I brought the money that they used in forming that party, every penny, in 1997 and 1998, and I later became a thief. “People I gave transport money from my house in VI became agents. This is what Nigeria represents. “Thank you for giving me these four years of uninterrupted support. This country is not fair.”
