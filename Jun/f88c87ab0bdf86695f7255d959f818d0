A former Special Assistant in the Presidency, Dr. Olu Bajowa, OFR, has admonished President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to leverage on his strong local and interna­tional contacts in revamping the ailing nation’s security and economy systems. Dr Bajomo, retired military general in the Nigerian Army lamented that the level of inse­curity, restiveness, agitations and economic downturn were disturbing and that President Tinubu has the transformation ideas to turn things around. Bajowa, in his congratula­tory message made available to newsmen on Wednesday expressed optimism that the new administration of former Lagos governor would galvanise the citizens and guarantee the socio-economic development of the country. He admonished the president to deploy his capacity, intelli­gence and courage to steer the ship of the country and bring it back to its leading role in Af­rica and the world in terms of infrastructural development and systemic change. “I believe that the President can translate same transforma­tion to a diverse country like Nigeria, which has much bigger and more complex challenges.” “This feat is a testimony of your competence and pedigree, whilst confirming the trust and confidence the Nigerian people bestow on you. Judging by your track records in governance, leadership, and administrative acumen, I am confident in your capacity to completely overhaul the socio-political and econom­ic spheres of our great nation, Nigeria.”
