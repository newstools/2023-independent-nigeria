Former England defender Chris Smalling has signed a new two-year contract with Italian side Roma. The 33-year-old joined the Serie A club on a season-long loan from Manchester United in 2019 before he made the switch permanent in 2020. Smalling’s previous deal at the Stadio Olimpico was set to expire next month. “I’m playing the best football of my career here and my family and I have felt so welcome in this won­derful city from day one,” he told Roma’s website. “What’s more, this club is clearly taking great strides forward in all ar­eas. Choosing to remain at Roma was an easy decision to make.” Smalling, who has been capped 31 times by En­gland, has made 143 ap­pearances in all competi­tions for Roma and scored 10 goals. He has become a key player for the Gialloros­si under head coach Jose Mourinho and won the inaugural Europa Confer­ence League in 2022. The centre-back previ­ously played for non-league Maidstone United before he joined Fulham in June 2008. Smalling moved to Old Trafford in January 2010 where he won two Premier League titles, the FA Cup, League Cup and the Euro­pa League.
