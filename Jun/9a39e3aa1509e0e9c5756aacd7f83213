Borussia Dortmund are interested in a deal to sign Hannibal Mejbri from Manchester United this summer. Hannibal, 20, spent last season on loan with Championship side Birmingham and is attracting plenty of interest in the early stages of the summer transfer window. The Manchester Evening News understand Dortmund are just one of the sides monitoring a possible deal for the youngster, who faces a somewhat uncertain future at the club. It is understood the German side would be prepared to pay a fee in the region of €15million, which would include performance-related add-ons. United are set to give Hannibal a chance to prove his worth on the upcoming pre-season tour before making any concrete decision on his future, but they could entertain offers if they decide he is not yet first-team ready. Erik ten Hag has already made it clear that young players not up to his very high standards won’t be given an opportunity, and only world-class prospects will be given a proper chance under him. Hannibal has certainly shown glimpses of that talent but now faces an important few months to show Ten Hag what he could really offer to the first-team. It is not clear if United would even entertain a permanent sale for the Tunisian international, and any summer exit could well be another loan move before a firm decision is made. POLL United invested €10million in Hannibal when they signed him from Monaco four years ago and would certainly look to make a profit on him in the event of any sale. It would also be likely that the club would insist on a future sell-on clause if they were to cash-in on such promising young talent, just as they have done with Zidane Iqbal’s proposed move to FC Utrecht. Hannibal has made three senior appearances for the United first-team since his debut against Wolves on the final day of the 2020/21 season.
