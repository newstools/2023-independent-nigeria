ABUJA â€“ Former leader of the defunct Niger Delta Peoples Volunteer Force, Alhaji Asari Dokubo on Friday, met with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, where he accused the military high command of being behind oil bunkering in the Niger Delta region. Validating his claims, Dokubi said ordinary citizens cannot garner the resources and technology to engage in oil bunkering, especially connecting pipes directly to oil heads to tap crude. Asari who denied having a private security force, said he has been instrumental in the quelling of kidnapping and bandit crisis in the Niger and Kaduna state axis. He said he was happy with the firmness of Tinubu in handling national issues since he assumed office as President but noted that he would need all the support he can get from good-spirited Nigerians.
