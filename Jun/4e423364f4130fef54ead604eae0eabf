LAGOS – The management of International Aviation College (IAC), Ilorin has appealed to the Kwara State Government to appropriately fund it in order to prevent the institution from being sanctioned by the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). Capt. Yakubu Okatahi, Acting Rector of the College expressed this fear over the weekend at the college where he decorated five graduating students who have completed their commercial and private pilot license courses. Okatahi appealed to Governor Mal. AbdulRahman Abdulrasaq, the Kwara State Governor to come to the aid of the college, saying that this would enable it to remain in business. He, and other officials of the college, however, commended the governor for the regular subvention to it, which they said had enabled the school to remain in operation. He explained that the governor’s recent release of N75 million enabled the college to purchase a new aircraft engine and propeller, 10,000 litres of jet-A1, and repair of the college’s fuel dump, among others. The rector, however, appealed to the governor for increased funding to enable it meet all the requirements stipulated by the regulatory authority, NCAA. Okatahi told the governor that the present management inherited 55 students when it came on board in March, 2022 and said 27 of them had so far been graduated. He said the college could do better with sufficient funding by the State Government. POLL He assured the governor that the current management would not disappoint the State Government for the trust and confidence reposed in it. Mr. Mohammed Jibril, the Registrar of the College, congratulated the governor on his re-election for second term and as Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF). He therefore pleaded with the governor for the upward review of the college’s monthly subvention to enable it implement salary structure for her staff as obtained in sister institutions like the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), Zaria.
