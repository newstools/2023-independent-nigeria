P/HARCOURT  – President of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), Fegalo Nsuke, has said that reconciliation with oil companies operating in the area is made impossible when there is sustained on-going harm. In a comment on his Twitter handle, Nsuke noted that preaching reconciliation when there is sustained on-going harm is hypocritical and unjust. Nsuke made the comment weeks after a book launch in Port Harcourt by the Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Most Rev. Matthew Hassan Kukah who served on a reconciliation team set up by the former President Olusegun Obasanjo regime to address the issue of oil production in Ogoni. Former president, Olusegun Obasanjo and the immediate past Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike had used the occasion to talk about reconciliation in Ogoni lands. Without a direct reference to Bishop Kukah’s book launch, Nsuke’s tweet reads: “Reconciliation is impossible with sustained and on-going harm. For there to be true reconciliation, the process must be fair and just which demands that those who suffer losses must be compensated in some way to remedy their sufferings”. “It is also important for those whose actions have destroyed society to be brought to account. We have not seen a commitment on the part of Shell and the Nigerian government towards true reconciliation in Ogoni”, Nsuke said. He called on the government of Nigeria and key Nigerian oil industry players especially the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC or Shell) to put an end to the use of state military forces against civil agitations for fundamental rights and the use of divide and conquer methods to sustain conflicts between and within communities. POLL Nsuke further called for a transparent and practical commitment to a just and fair system which protects the future of the Ogoni and the Niger Delta people in decision making and resource allocation.
