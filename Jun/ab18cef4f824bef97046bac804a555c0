ENUGU – A vandal suspect identified as Samuel Ebuka Umenze, an in­digene of Amesi, Aguata Local Government Area, Anambra State, has been arrested for his role in vandalizing property of the Enugu Electricity Distri­bution Company PLC (EEDC) within the school premises. Samuel, a first-year student of Agric Extension with the University of Nigeria, Nsuk­ka (UNN), was arrested at the school premises by the insti­tution’s security, while large quantities of peeled coated cables and sophisticated equip­ment used for vandalism were recovered from his room. This was made known in a statement issued by the Head, Corporate Communications, EEDC, Mr. Emeka Ezeh, in Enugu on Friday. According to him, Samuel, while confessing to the crime, claimed he carries out the crim­inal act alone at night during classes and sells his loot to a buyer in Onitsha. Ezeh con­firmed that investigation is already ongoing to arrest the receiver of these vandalized items. In a related development, on Monday, at Oshituma, Ohauk­wu Local Government Area, Ebonyi State, three vandal suspects identified as Fleke Kingsley, Egbo Friday, and Oke­fe Stanley were arrested by the community vigilante while in possession of 3 bags containing about 6 spans of aluminum conductors suspected to belong to EEDC. Also, recently at Abakaliki, a suspect identified as Chine­mere Obiah was arrested by Civil Security Guards attached to the Federal Teaching Hospi­tal, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, in possession of upriser cables suspected to belong to EEDC. Ezeh lamented at the in­creasing rate at which EEDC facilities are being attacked by vandals and called on custom­ers to remain vigilant and en­sure the electricity installations serving them are not attacked by vandals.
