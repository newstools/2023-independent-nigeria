****Student Loan Scheme: Safer To Educate More Nigerians ***Suspension of CBN, EFCC Heads Not Vendetta ****Opening of Land Borders To Create Jobs In Affected Communities ****Forex Policy To Strengthen Banking Sector, Economy ABUJA – The allegation of tribal sentiment surrounding the recent appointments of aides by President Bola Tinubu has been described as “unwarranted.” The appointments according to former Chief of Staff to the Imo State government, Uche Nwosu, were made based on competence, and to prevent political distractions, and for would-be ministers to deliver in record time. He said that the appointees may have been so appointed to draw up a blueprint for the lifetime of the administration. On the need for a job safety net to absorb beneficiaries of the new education loan scheme signed into law by the president, Nwosu urged for increased education of Nigerians, warning that “it is more dangerous not to go to school. POLL It is good to go to school and come out and start looking for jobs. The boys that are being recruited by Boko Haram, it is because they didn’t go to school. And somebody can easily psych their brains. And before you know it, they take guns and join Boko Haram. “An educated man who has gone through the walls of a university, it is difficult for someone to convince him to take guns and enter the bush and start shooting. “But it is easier to convince someone who has never seen education at all. For me, let’s educate as many as we can, and let it be that we’re now looking for a job for them.” “Education remains the best thing that could happen to this country. It is more frustrating not to go school, and be pushing wheelbarrows or be a Bus conductor,” he added. He also called on Nigerians to be patient with the administration especially as it regards the suspension of the Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, and his EFCC counterpart, Abdulrasheed Bawa. According to him, the report of vendetta in the federal government’s action is misplaced, as he recalled earlier allegations by the State Security Services (SSS) against the suspended Apex bank governor. “If you say it is a vendetta, does it mean that because somebody ran an election with me, and that person has questions to answer I should not investigate him because of what people would say. The country will fall into the pit. He is the President now, and he needs to sanitize wherever he can. And he also needs to have a team with which he can work.” While fielding questions on the recent directive by the President to reopen the country’s land borders, the former Chief of Staff dismissed fears that it may impact negatively on the economy. “It would rather help restore those thousands of jobs that were lost due to the closure of the borders. While at the same time, allowing Nigerians to focus on what they can produce locally. “Remember that there are thousands and millions of Nigerians that lost their jobs because of the closure of these borders. You have people there doing their businesses, selling groundnuts, and you have poor women there selling Mama-put by the side of the road. “The closure of the border everybody left. It’s not going to make us lazy to produce what we normally produce in this country. “For me, I like local rice. So, even if you bring thousands of foreign rice I will not eat. In fact, Nigerians have gotten used to local rice. We’ll still produce our own rice. We’ll still produce some of the things we produce. “Now, a lot of Nigerians have learnt to produce toothpicks. So, it’s better for me to produce toothpicks, than going to buy foreign toothpicks that are very expensive. Producing here is easier with the Bamboo trees than buying it, importing it and transporting it.” On the emergence of the leadership of the 10th National Assembly, he commended the 9th Senate for some achievements, such as the Electoral Act 2022, the Petroleum Industry Act, among others. He however flayed the out-gone legislature for approving the loan request by the former administration, a few days to the end of the government. This is as he defended President Tinubu’s option for Godswill Akpabio as the President of the Senate; even as he expressed optimism that the now comatose Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) will be resuscitated by its new Chairman and Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma. He called on the new government to “end nepotism and hunger”, adding that “I want to see an economy that’s friendly to the people. I want to see a country where we’ll have 24-hour light, a country where the poor people in the rural areas will have a clinic or health centres where they can go and treat themselves; where children can go to school and the schools will not have leaking roofs; where my green passport will be respected in every country.” Nsowu further hailed the executive’s decision to narrow foreign exchange to only the formal sector, as he explained that it would help to strengthen the banking sector, and the economy in general.
