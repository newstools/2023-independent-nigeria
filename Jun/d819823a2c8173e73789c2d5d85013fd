The member representing Awka South 1 state Constituency, Hon. Henry Chidimma Mbachu has pledged to be accountable to his people and carry everybody along in the course of representing them. Mbachu who is one of the seven members elected on the platform of Labour Party in Anambra State said he will start where his predecessor stopped and will carry his people along because people misrepresent lawmakers when they are not carried along, especially in executing projects for which Constituency fund is allocated. He spoke on Sunday shortly after a Thanksgiving service which was attended by the Deputy Governor Dr. Onyekachukwu Ibezim and top government officials in Awka. He said he will fight to get what is due to his Constituency and that such projects will be tabled before his Constituents to decide. He also debunked insinuations that lawmakers receive jumbo pay saying that their earnings are there in the Internet for all to see. He predicted a cordial relationship with the Governor saying: “We won’t be rubber stamp. Anything that comes to the table that will benefit our people, I will get it by all means. But we are not going to fight. We are seven members of Labour Party and we won’t go there to fight. “All our allowances will be channeled to the purpose for which they are meant”. Earlier in the church, Hon. Mbachu attributed his election victory to God. POLL Citing the book of Romans chapter 9: 11-15 he said: “it is only God that will explain what happened in Awka South I state Constituency. If we are to talk of those who will go, I am not fit. God just showed mercy to me”. Deputy Governor Ibezim who accompanied him to the church said God uplifts people from being nobody to somebody. He said he sympathises with Mbachu because of enormous work  await him as lawmaker which people don’t put into account and urged him to contribute his own quota. He said he is pleased that the calibre of Mbachu is representing his Constituency# Photo: Hon . Mbachu
