The Otun Olubadan of Ibadanland, High Chief Rasidi Adewolu Ladoja may not be part of the eleven (11) Ibadan High Chiefs recently elevated to become beaded crown Obas by Governor Seyi Makinde. It could be recalled that the Oyo State Governor had signed into law the State Chieftaincy system bill as amended by the Oyo State Legislature which gives the governor the sole power to decide who becomes what in Oyo traditional council. The Oyo state government has picked 7th July 2023 as the coronation day. A source very close to the former governor, Senator Rasidi Ladoja, who pleaded anonymity hinted on Friday that, Otun Olubadan will distance himself from the coronation of the High Chiefs as beaded crown Obas. According to him, “Baba is presently in Cotonou. He has not made his position known on this new development but I can tell you he will not be part of this comedy. “The last time I spoke with him about it. What he said was that he did not set out to become a lesser Oba when he began the journey. His dream is to become the Olubadan and nothing less. “I think Baba will be available in Ibadan before Sallah. He will surely make his position known. You know he doesn’t have the power to stop others from being crowned. But as for him, he will not be part of the coronation of High Chiefs. Baba has nothing against the elevation of those Baales to beaded crown Obas once due process is followed”, the source submitted. He went further to state that the former Governor may likely approach the court to challenge the decision of the government on this development.
