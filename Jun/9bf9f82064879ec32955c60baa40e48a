LAGOS  – A food company, Eden Group through its Initiative, e-moringa food and logistics, has entered into a partnership with the Abuja Cooperative Federation to make its food products more affordable for Nigerians. Using a cooperative model, the partnership is aimed at delivering an installment payment system for a period of five months for food items that cost N55,000 in the package. The project which is tagged: “Operation Feed the Nation” is targeted at serving both civil servants and private individuals with a registered membership of cooperative societies across the nation and helping them achieve zero hunger objectives. Addressing newsmen in Abuja during a visit to the secretariat of Abuja Cooperative Federation, recently, the Chief Executive Officer of Eden Group, Dr. Michael Ashimashiga noted that the packaged product and services will go far to reduce the effect of the high cost of food on the vulnerable persons in the country in the era of financial burden occasioned by the fuel subsidy removal. He said the cooperative will pay 20 percent of the total cost of the food items while the individual pays the balance of 80 percent for the period of five months. Ashimashiga said: “This product is to help and then liaise with this cooperative that we have paid a working visit to them to show them our products and services so that they can in turn, reach out to all the cooperatives, who are recognised units in every sector and take some of these products given to the staff or registered members and then they pay for them gradually”. The President, Abuja Cooperative Federation, Emmanuel Atama, in his remarks, assured the group of his commitment to buy into the initiative.
