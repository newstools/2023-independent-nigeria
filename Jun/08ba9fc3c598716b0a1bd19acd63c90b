LAGOS  – Dr. Adetokunbo Pearse, a Peo­ples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain in Lagos State, has called on President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to ensure devolution of power to states to give room for the creation of state police, if he hopes to arrest the threatening insecurity in the country. The former gubernatorial candidate in Lagos and Coordi­nator, Atiku-Okowa Presidential Campaign Support Groups in the state in the last general elections, in a chat with our correspondent, said the country should return to the pre-independence era when states had major control over their affairs, saying since Nige­ria is practising a federal system of government, it was imperative that there should be devolution of power. “For security, it is about em­powering the states because the Federal Government cannot ef­fectively secure the states. Tinubu has to have, as we had in the past before independence, state police. “This is necessary because in any federal system as we claim to be practicing, there must be devo­lution of power to the states. Do that and you have it right. What money have we not spent in train­ing and arming our security forc­es, still nothing to show for it? The coordinator of Jonathan/ Sambo Presidential Campaign Organisation in Lagos in 2015, said the job is already cut out for the president, however stressing that the task ahead is enormous for President Tinubu. He averred that he earlier believed so much that Tinubu would fix the economy, however, expressed pessimism that with the way he started by allegedly throwing the country into chaos through fuel subsidy pronounce­ment, he had his doubts on Mr. President.
