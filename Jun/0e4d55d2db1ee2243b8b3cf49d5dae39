Manchester United are interested in signing Manuel Ugarte from Sporting CP but the latest update suggests he has accepted a move to Chelsea. As per today’s version of Record (news image provided below), the Blues will seal the signing of the Uruguayan international for £55.8m (65 million euros). The London club will activate the clause of 60 million euros and will also pay 5 million euros in add-ons. Part of the fee will go to the player’s former club, Famalicao. Manchester United and PSG also submitted salary proposals to lure the South American defensive midfielder. However, Record claim that Ugarte wants to move to Chelsea and has accepted personal terms to secure his move to Stamford Bridge. PSG were offering around 5 million euros per season but Mauricio Pochettino’s team have been able to convince him by offering 3.5 million euros per season plus bonuses. A move to Man Utd or PSG would have allowed the player to play in the Champions League next season but at Old Trafford, the first choice DM is Casemiro and Verratti is the main holding midfielder for the Ligue 1 champions. Manuel Ugarte will have a better chance of starting at Chelsea. He will likely replace outgoing N’Golo Kante, who will be out of contract this month.
