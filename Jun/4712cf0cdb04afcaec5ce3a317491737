Popular Nollywood actor widely regarded as the tallest man in Nigeria, Afeez Agoro Oladimeji, is dead. Agoro was reported to have passed away on Thursday after a prolonged illness. Before his demise, Agoro was 7ft 4in tall. The deceased, who was featured in some movies, attracted stares wherever he went. Community Development Association, the community where the actor resides, Segun Adesanya, confirmed his demise. “Afeez Agoro lives on Community Road and it is sad we lost a promising young man. May his soul rest in peace,” Adesanya told The Nation. Agoro, who was also a TV personality and has a show called ‘I am Agoro’ airing exclusively on Linda Ikeji TV, had in May 2023 solicited for N5 million for treatment. He solicited N5m for his chronic hip arthritis treatment, which will see his ball and socket joint replaced.
