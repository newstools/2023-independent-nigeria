ABUJA – A group, under the aus­pices of the Association of Ebonyi Indigenes So­cio-Cultural in the Diaspo­ra, (AEISCID) has reacted to recent comments cred­ited to the husband of the former President of the Court of Appeal, Adamu Muhammad Bulkachuwa, enjoining Nigerians with discerning minds not to take such statements with a pinch of salt. Recall that Senator Bulka­chuwa had during a valedic­tory session for the 9th Senate revealed that he had reasons to intervene for his friends and colleagues while his wife, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa served as the President of Ni­geria’s Court of Appeal. However, in a statement circulated by Amb. Paschal Oluchukwu, AEISCID Presi­dent, worldwide, on Monday, in Abuja, the National Judi­cial Commission, NJC- the body vested with the powers to appoint and discipline err­ing judicial staff under the Nigerian legal system should not treat Bulkachuwa’s com­ment with kid gloves. The group, however, drew reference to a pending elec­tion case in the tribunal, say­ing the news which broke out on the 26th of April 2023 that the President of the Court of Appeal, Her Lordship, Justice Monica Dongban-Mensah has ordered the immediate relo­cation of both the National Assembly and Governorship/ State House of Assembly elec­tions petitions tribunals to Abuja from Abakaliki where cases were initially billed to be tried and determined was a huge relief. Though the Court never made its reasons public, Olu­chukwu said the fact remains that Ebonyi has been in the news not only for insecurity but more particularly for the way and manner the immedi­ate past Governor of the State, Engr. David Umahi operated and handled the judicial arm of government in the State and in the country at large. “We recall that the first time arguably in the history of the judiciary when a Court was sacked following a coordi­nated attack by political thugs and both men of the Bar and the Bench in Ebonyi had to take to their heels by scaling the fence was around early December 2014. “The then ruling People’s Democratic Party, PDP had planned to hold its primary election to elect a flagbearer for the ruling PDP in the State for the 2015 Governorship elec­tion on the 6th of December, 2014.”
