UYO – A civil society organi­sation, Policy Alert, has urged President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to com­mence a thorough inves­tigation of all crude oil swap deals entered into by the Nigerian Government with commodity traders since 2010. Such investigation, accord­ing to the NGO whose goal is to promote economic and ecological justice in Nigeria, would help expose and bring to book those who facilitated or benefited from the corrup­tion-prone regimes. In a release endorsed by head of the NGO’s Media Unit, Nneka Luke-Ndumn­were, and made available to our correspondent in Uyo on Wednesday, Policy Alert recalled that the Group Man­aging Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Compa­ny Limited (NNPCL), Mele Kyari, had announced re­cently that the company had commenced the termination of crude oil swap deals and that the national oil company would now pay for its purchas­es in cash, adding that less pet­rol would be imported by NN­PCL while private companies would import the bulk. However, in a public con­versation on the theme, ‘Ben­eficial ownership and Nige­ria’s crude swaps – priorities for the new administration’, organised by Policy Alert on Twitter Space on Wednesday, the civil society organisation said while the decision of the NNPCL to end crude oil swap deals was commend­able, it would only amount to half-measures if the cor­rupt and inefficient system underpinning the swaps was not investigated, lost revenue recovered, culprits punished, and safeguards instituted.
