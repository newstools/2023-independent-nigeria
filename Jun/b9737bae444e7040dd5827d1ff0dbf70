The Advertising Regulatory Council of Nigeria (ARCON) has issued a warning to the general public regarding an advertisement by Tiwa Commercial Hub, a real estate company that is currently being circulated on various online media platforms. ARCON has expressed concerns over the advertisement, which solicits investments and makes extravagant promises of a 32% return. According to ARCON, the advertisement has gained attention due to its enticing offers; however, it has not undergone the necessary vetting and approval process by the Advertising Standard Panel (ASP), as mandated by the Advertising Regulatory Council of Nigeria Act No 23 of 2022. In a statement released recently, Dr. Olalekan Fadolapo, FCA, rpa, the Director-General of ARCON, emphasized the organization’s commitment to addressing this issue. He stated, “ARCON will continue to collaborate with other law enforcement agencies to combat this trend and ensure integrity within the Nigerian Advertising Industry.” ARCON advises the general public to exercise caution and remain vigilant when encountering such investment solicitations. The regulatory body expressed its concern over the increasing number of unapproved investment advertisements on online media platforms, which poses a risk to the savings of unsuspecting individuals. “We will persistently work with other law enforcement agencies to curtail this practice and maintain the standards of the Nigerian Advertising Industry,” added Dr. Fadolapo. Furthermore, ARCON intends to take legal action against individuals or corporate entities that sponsor, cause to be exposed, or expose unapproved advertisements on any medium without the necessary approval of the ASP, by the Nigerian Code of Advertising.
