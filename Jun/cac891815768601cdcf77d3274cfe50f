The Lagos State Police Command has arrested a dismissed corporal allegedly impersonating a serving Inspector of Police. Police spokesman, SP Benjamin Hundeyin told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday at Ikeja that police operatives arrested the suspect on June 4 at Gaskiya College Road Junction, Ijora-Badija. He said the 35-year-old suspect resident at Sango Ota in Ogun was arrested while riding an unregistered motorcycle. He added that a police stop-and-search team accosted the suspect and interrogated him to establish why he was riding a motorcycle on a major road despite an order banning such activity. “The suspect identified himself as a Police Inspector and brought out a police identification card bearing his name and photograph and depicting him as an Inspector of Police. “During investigation, police got a court order to search his home at Sango Ota and conducted the search on June 8. “In the process, a pair of uniforms with Sergeant rank, one operational jacket with inscription SARS LAS SCORPION’, one pair of camouflage with Inspector rank and one jacket withSpecial Forces’ inscription were recovered. “Also recovered from the suspect was one police belt, a pair of police boots, one camouflage tee-shirt, one police beret with crest and one pair of unsewn blue uniform,’’ he said. POLL Hundeyin said a preliminary investigation showed that the suspect had been using the uniforms since his dismissal from the police in 2017. He added that the investigation also showed that the suspect had been changing his rank anytime the police promoted his serving recruited mates. Hundeyin also told NAN that the suspect would be arraigned upon completion of investigation.
