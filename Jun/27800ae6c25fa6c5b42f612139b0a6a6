Following the discontinuation of the petition by the Action Alliance against the governor of Oyo State, Engr Seyi Makinde, the governorship election petition tribunal in the state has dismissed the petition of the party and its gubernatorial candidate, Babatunde Samson Ajala against the governor. The three-man tribunal led by Justice Ejiro Emudainohwu delivered the judgement on Friday. Other members of the tribunal that sat in Ibadan, the state capital are Justices Baraka Wali and I. S. Galadima. Counsel to AA and its candidate; Etibo Orowo King in his presentation on Friday told the tribunal that the party and its candidate have decided to discontinue the case. He urged the tribunal to strike out the case in the interest of the state. “My prayer is for the cancellation of the result of the election. But, further reevaluation, we decided to discontinue the case in the interest of peace and tranquillity”. Counsel to the governor who is the second respondent, Kunle Kalejaye (SAN) in his presentation then urged the tribunal to dismiss the case. “The petitioner said that the case should be struck out. We want the case to be dismissed. It is a petition that is dead on arrival” POLL The tribunal led by Emudainohwu then dismissed the case. The tribunal then awarded a sum of N100,000 in favour of first respondent (Independent National Electoral Commission), a sum of N250,000 in favour of the second respondent (Governor Makinde) and a sum of N250,000 in favour of the third respondent (Peoples Democratic Party). It could be recalled that Makinde was declared the winner of the gubernatorial election held on Saturday, 18th March 2023 but AA and its candidate approached the tribunal and called for the cancellation of the election result owing to the alleged exclusion of the name of its candidate. But on the Friday hearing the party and its candidate decided to discontinue the matter.
