LAGOS – The Port Standing Task Team (PSTT), has reiterated its commitment to continually sanitise all the nation’s ports and ensure they are rid of corruption and unnecessary delays in cargo clearance. Moses Fadipe National Coordinator of the team stated this in Lagos while speaking at the 10th anniversary event of Portbisness at Apapa. According to him, the advent of the task team has brought about efficiency in the nation’s port system, which had blocked revenue leakages and sustained foreign investments. He noted that after dismantling all the illegal road blocks and extortion points on the Apapa port corridor, the PSTT is not resting on its oars but, doing everything possible to eradicate traffic congestion caused by trucks to enable free flow of vehicles. He said: “The work of the team has been praised for its transparency and effectiveness and has helped to build confidence in the country’s maritime sector. The strict monitoring of joint cargo examinations by the Task Team has also yielded significant benefits. “This has helped to ensure that all cargoes are properly examined and cleared before being released, promoting efficiency and transparency in the clearance process. This has helped to improve the overall efficiency of cargo clearance and turnaround time. “Another significant achievement has been the success of “Operation Free the Ports’ Corridor” in dismantling illegal checkpoints and extortion points along the port’s corridor. This has helped to reduce the incidence of corrupt practices and the high cost of doing business in our ports.” Fadipe listed monetary savings, turnaround time, cargo dwell time, improved movement of haulage, reduction in unreceipted charges, and reduction in incidents of infractions as some of the achievements of the team during the short period it has existed.
