Operatives of Osun Amotekun Corps have arrested two young men, Joseph Dennis, 20 years, and Friday Agogo, 29 years for armed robbery and the attempted murder of a market woman at Ila-Orangun, Osun State. According to information made available by the Corps Commander of the security outfit, Brigadier General Bashir Adewinmbi on Saturday, the duo are indigenes of Benue State. Adewinmbi also revealed that both were arrested after a complaint was lodged at the Amotekun Command in Ila by the affected woman. According to him, “The operatives of the corps swung into action immediately and apprehended the culprits in their hideout. “The suspects attacked the woman at Thick Area Elemo Ogun Community on her way to Ila-Orangun town after selling her farm’s produce and they collected her money and also attempted to stab her with a knife. “They covered their faces with masks for the woman not to recognise them but the woman recognised one of the suspect’s voice. “The suspects confessed to perpetrating the act and that they have been involved in such activities for a very long time,” Adewinmbi said. Adewinmbi said the suspects have been handed over to the police for subsequent investigation and interrogation.
