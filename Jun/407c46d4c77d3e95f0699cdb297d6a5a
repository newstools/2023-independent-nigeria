LAGOS  – The President of the Nigerian Academy of Engineering (NAE), Professor Azikiwe Onwualu, has stressed the need for strong institutions to be in place in order to effectively enforce all our laws and policies. Onwualu, dropped the hint in an address he delivered at the 2023 Annual Lecture, Investiture of new Felows and Life achievement awards ceremony of the Academy held at the Professor Ajayi Auditorium, University of Lagos,Akoka. His words: “As the new administration at Federal and State levels settle down to the business of governance, we note that Nigeria is not lacking in policies and laws. “ In the past, we had Development Plans, Executive Orders, Acts and Bills of national and state Assemblies, in addition to global programmes by development partners. “We are also not lacking in natural minerals as the country is blessed with rich land and water resources, oil and gas, solid minerals, agricultural products and above all ,smart human resources” He went on: “What we are lacking are: strong institutions for effective implementation of the policies and laws; appropriate feedback-based monitoring and evaluation systems and use of engineering and technology to optimize project implementation. In this regard, therefore, the following are recommended for the new government at Federal and State levels. He identified the use of merit – based approach in selecting the human resources to lead the various MDAs, taking into consideration, the need for inclusiveness, accommodation of disadvantaged groups (women, youths, physically challenged),geographical, ethnic and religious consideration. Onwualu, further said that Professional Miniseries should be headed by relevant experienced professionals. In particular, engineering based MDAs should be headed by professional engineers or allied professionals POLL He identified such Ministries as Power, Works, Environment, Communication and Digital Economy, Water Resources, Science and Technology and Innovation, Industry, Trade and Investment, Transportation, Aviation, Mines and Steel Development. According to him, efforts should be made to build and strengthen institutions of government as they are key in policy implementation adding that the Academy recommends a systematic peer review of MDAs towards some form of ranking, rationalisation and monitoring and evaluation to optimise performance and productivity. He pointed out, that technology is at the root if knowledge economy of today, adding that Nigeria should make conscious and sustainable efforts towards using industry 4.0 technologies for development in all sectors. According to him, for this to happen government needs to strengthen the efforts in the area of acquisition and dissemination of emerging technologies and using them for development. The NAE President said that the Federal Government should declare a state of emergency in the area of critical infrastructure including: Electricity Transpiration, Housing, Manufacturing and Security. He said that the Academy was ready to assist the government at Federal and State levels in providing advice in actualising the suggestions made and others in the area of using engineering and technology to drive development. Azikiwe ,said that following the induction of the Fellows, they are expected to join at least one of the following committees of the Academy: Agriculture, Editorial, Emerging Engineering, Engineering Business Promotion, Engineering Education, Environment and Climate Change ,ICT, Oil and Gas, Power, Quality and Standards, Renewable Energy amongst other committees in the Academy. According to him the new inductees would be required to present a technical paper in the first year of their induction at one of the Academy’s Fellows Forum, making recommendations on solution to at least one engineering problem in Nigeria. He further said the new inductees are expected to mentor young engineers and they are also expected join other Fellows in advocacy towards solving engineering infrastructural challenges of Nigeria.
