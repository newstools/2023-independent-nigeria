 Athletics Federation of Nigeria, AFN, has pointedly accused Bola Mogaji, chairman, of Kwara State Sports Commission, KSC, of sheer negligence, weak oversight capacity which both led to an indefinite ban of the state from athletics activities in the country on Saturday. AFN, in a news release, said that Kwara State Athletics Association, Kwara AA, is baned from all athletics activities in the country, following its association with banned athletics coach Hammid Muritala. The sanction carries severe implications from Kwara State as almost an entire generation of sportsmen and women may never have opportunities of making it big in athletics. Coach Muritala was banned 10 years for admitting to doping junior athlete Fatimah Abdulazziz with banned substance during the National Youth Games held in Ilorin Kwara State. Rather give the disgraced coach a wide berth, Magaji, according to insiders, allegedly incorporated his services in the grooming of athletes in Kwara State. As also gathered, worried stakeholders called Magaji’s attention to the potential damage such association with Coach Muri with KSC and athletes will cost the state. Rather than heed the warnings, Mogaji, the state’s athetics association, proceeded, brazenly, in error. POLL Muri, on several occasions was seen coaching athletes from the state with full knowledge of the Kwara Athletics Association and the Kwara State Sports Commission led by Magaji. Coach Muri as he is fondly called was also spotted at the AFN Golden League held in Benin City on Thursday. Speaking on the matter, AFN said: ”This action also amounts to violation of Rule 2.9 of World Athletics Anti-Doping Rules: The Kwara AA shall remain suspended, pending the outcome of further investigation,” AFN release said.
