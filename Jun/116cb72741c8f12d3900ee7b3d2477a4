The coalition of Ijaw interest groups and other critical stake­holders in the environmental sector on Wednesday urged President Bola Tinubu and the Governor of Bayelsa State, Sen­ator Douye Diri to promulgate a Niger Delta-wide Environmental Remediation Programme. ‘’The Bayelsa State Govern­ment, the Federal Government, the Ministers of Petroleum and Environment, and the regulators (NOSDRA particularly) that have brushed aside and overlooked this dangerous and destructive pollution slowly killing people in the region and desecrating the ecosystem now have a core duty and responsibility to bring this environmental genocide to an immediate stop”. They also canvassed stern sanctions including revocation of rights of way and land leases over operational sites of repeat­ed or egregious environmental breaches. ‘’In the four years of waiting for the Commission’s Report, the state government appears to have done little or nothing in combat­ing the scourge which kept occur­ring not only routinely as usual but also in outrageous dimen­sions on several occasions. Agip’s facilities drenched Lasukugbene and its surroundings with crude oil for weeks in 2021. “Conoil callously spewed oil and gas repeatedly for extended periods in the Akassa axis in the same year. Shell has not only soaked Ikarama Community in spills during the period but has had NOSDRA issue clean-up cer­tificates for sites that still contain ponds of spilled oil. And the Aiteo Group which took over some oil­fields and facilities in allegedly hazardous states from Shell was the host of the catastrophic San­ta Barbara Oilfield blowout that lasted for 5-6 weeks in 2021. “
