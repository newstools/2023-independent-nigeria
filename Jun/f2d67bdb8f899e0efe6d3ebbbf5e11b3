Embattled Head Coach of Kwara Athletics Association, KAA, Adeniyi Awe, has explained that disgraced former head coach of the association, Hammeed Muritala, deceived him into joining Kwara’s athletics contingent to Benin for the AFN Golden League, saying he regrets the entire outcome of the saga. Speaking to journalists in Ilorin on Monday, Awe said he only allowed the banned coach to join them in the bus after he pleaded that he needed to be in Benin for further hearing on his case. Coach Muri, as he is popularly called, is currently serving a 10-year ban from the Athletics Federation of Nigeria, AFN, after admitting to having force-fed a youth athlete with a banned substance two years ago in Ilorin. By implication, all affiliates of AFN are to cease all forms of athletics-related fraternity with him. The ban also precludes him from being anywhere near young athletes. But Awe said he only showed compassion to Muritala and that he had nothing to do with the team or athletes immediately after touching down in Benin and throughout their stay. “If I had known it was a lie, I wouldn’t have permitted him to join us on the trip,” said the totally subdued coach. Awe is under investigation by the Kwara State Sports Commission, KSC, over AFN suspension of Kwara athletes indefinitely after Muri was discovered in company of athletes in Benin.
