NICHOLAS UWERUNONYE Ahead of the 17th edition of Africa’s largest housing and construction expo, Africa International Housing Show (AIHS), convener, Festus Adebayo said the expectation for the 2023 AIHS is different. He noted that it is a time to make more impact on the economy and not just the housing sector. In an interview with newsmen in Abuja, Adebayo noted that AIHS has launched its mobile application to give participants updates from time to time prior to the commencement of the event. “The venue of the event will be opened two days before the commencement of the event to allow the construction of customized booths. “On Monday, 24th of July will feature very important personalities from across Africa and the world, and immediately after the opening ceremony, there shall be an all-important CEOs’ forum, which is a convergence of elite chief executives from Nigeria and across the world, to devise the most effective solutions to the challenges in the housing and construction industry. An avenue for CEOs to network and share the latest trends in the housing, mortgage, construction and real estate industry at large.” He also added that the second day of the event will feature an international-finance session, which will focus on how the International Finance Corporation IFC can assist real estate developers in the area of affordable housing.
