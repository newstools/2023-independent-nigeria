German-born Ghanaian model wears many hats that put her in the spotlight. She is an actress-cum-film producer and was the second runner-up in Miss Malaika 2003 and winner of Miss Ghana-Germany in 2005. Today though, the Black Girl Magic spotlight is on Nana, not because of her many entertainment industry achievement, but her stand as a fashion icon. An award-winning fashionista, the mother of two children for the last two years has brought colour to the AMVCAs red carpet. Beyond that, she steadily makes a statement with her style and choice of outfits.
