BENIN – The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Ambrose Alli Universi­ty, Ekpoma, chapter, on Wednesday, faulted the Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki, for not putting an end to the activities of the Special Intervention Team (SIT) in the institu­tion having exhausted the 90 days ultimatum earlier agreed to. This was contained in a statement signed by Dr. Cyril Oziegbe Onogbosele and Dr. William Odion, Chairperson and Assistant Secretary of ASUU AAU, Ekpoma, respec­tively and made available to newsmen in Benin City. The duo said at the stake­holders’ meeting, the voices of stakeholders (including staff and students of the Uni­versity, politicians, traditional rulers, religious leaders, busi­nessmen and women, retirees of the university, staff unions of the university, civil society organizations and legal lumi­naries) was loud and clear on the issues in discourse. They said one of the issues raised was on whether or not SIT should be replaced with a governing council. They noted that the state­ment said on that issue, the thunderous and unanimous voice of the stakeholders that SIT should be dissolved was such that the governor issued 90 days ultimatum to SIT to conclude its activities in the university to pave way for the constitution and inaugu­ration of a governing council. They both said from March 16, 2023 to date, 90 days had gone without the implemen­tation of the decision on SIT. They maintained that stake­holders had kicked against the inaction of the governor in respect of his decision on the tenure of SIT in AAU, Ekpoma during the aforesaid stakehold­ers’ meeting. They also expressed dissat­isfaction over the non-imple­mentation of the decision of the governor during the same stakeholders’ meeting to inau­gurate the panel constituted to deal with the various crises plaguing the university.
