Ngobili said if anyone is criticising, such criticism must be constructive and must be tailored towards realising the vision for project Anambra as expanded by the governor Professor Charles Chukwuma Soludo, whom he described as a very hard-working and visionary governor. He said insecurity really distorted progress in Ihiala 1state constituency but expressed happiness that insecurity is being tackled vigorously in the area, stressing that if security is gotten right, the job of representation will be visible. Ngobili emphasized that security is on the front burner of his stewardship for Ihiala 1 state constituency, adding that security for the citizenry, participation of the government in provision of security and provision of infrastructure will all be done simultaneously. Ngobili therefore assured the people of Ihiala 1 state constituency of quality and efficient representation in the 8th assembly. POLL He also stated that Governor Soludo is moving step by step in his developmental approach.
