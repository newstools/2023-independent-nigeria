Conor Coady is poised to leave Wolves and join Leicester in a deal worth a possible £8.5million. The clubs have agreed a switch which will see Wolves receive an initial £7.5m fee for their former skipper, with a further £1m to follow should the Foxes earn a return to the Premier League. Coady is due to undergo a medical on Thursday ahead of completing a move which will bring to an end his stay at Molineux, during which time he made more than 300 appearances for the club. More to follow.
