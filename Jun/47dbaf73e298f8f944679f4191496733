LAGOS  – Eight Host Community Development Trusts (HCDTs) have been unveiled in Rivers State as NNPC/ SPDC/TotalEnergies/NAOC Joint Venture consolidates the gains of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in the region. The same number of HCDTs has already been unveiled in Yenagoa, and the latest ceremony brings to 16 the Trusts which have been presented to the public out of the 22 incorporated in the joint venture’s areas of operations in Imo, Rivers, Delta and Bayelsa states. “The Rivers State Government welcomes the establishment of Trusts and will support them to achieve their objectives,” said the acting Permanent Secretary, Rivers State Ministry of Chieftaincy and Community Affairs, Mrs. Blessing Orlukwo, who represented the Commissioner at the unveiling ceremony. Mr. Wessel de Haas, Deputy Managing Director of The Shell Petroleum Development Company Limited (SPDC), said: “The hope of SPDC, as the operator of the joint venture, is that the unveiling of the Trusts will set the tone for a better narrative and the dawn of a new era in the Niger Delta.” Highlighting the impact of crude theft, pipeline vandalism and social unrest on the operations of oil companies, Mr. de Haas enjoined members of the HCDTs to take advantage of the grievance-resolving provisions of the PIA and ensure hitch-free oil and gas explorations and production activities to guarantee funding for the trusts. He said communities should not allow “internal strife and chieftaincy struggles to negatively impact the setting up of or operations of Trusts in their areas.” The Chief Upstream Investment Officer, NNPC Upstream Investment Management Services (NUIMS), Mr. Bala Wunti, who was represented by Deputy Manager, External Relations, Mrs. Bunmi Lawson, advised the Trusts “to demonstrate efficiency and expertise in executing projects using means that amplify standard and quality and ensuring that the allocated funds are used for impactful initiatives that address the identified needs of the communities.”
