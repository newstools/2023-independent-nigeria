The National Director of Publici­ty of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Hakeem Baba Ahmed, has said that Muslim-Muslim ticket is a fraud. Baba Ahmed stated this during an interview on Chan­nels TV’s Politics Today, while commenting on APC’s zoning of Senate Presidency. He said the legislators should be allowed to decide whom they want to lead them. According to him, the North Western region should be al­lowed to produce the next Sen­ate President, saying their votes brought President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to power. Commenting on the Mus­lim-Muslim ticket in Kaduna State, he said, “What did he (El-Rufai) do for the Muslims? He demolished their houses. Nine­ty-five percent of the houses and buildings he demolished belong to Muslims. So for what value has Muslim-Muslim. It’s fraud. “Politicians have poisoned faith. They took it, made it a polit­ical capital. And they are fooling everybody. The earlier we open our eyes, the better. They are de­stroying the political process by bringing faith into it. They are deceiving people into thinking that they represent a class, which is not true.”
