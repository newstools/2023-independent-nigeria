Edo State First Lady, Her Excellency Betsy Obaseki has expressed her strong stance against domestic abuse, emphasising the need for women to prioritise their safety and well-being. Mrs Obaseki made her views known during a sympathy and heartfelt visit to a courageous survivor of domestic violence, Mrs Tina Okhiria whose arm was tragically amputated due to a gunshot allegedly inflicted by her abusive husband. During her visit, the First Lady spoke with the victim’s mother, seeking to understand the circumstances leading up to the incident and the actions taken by the family. The mother revealed that she was aware of the ongoing abuse and that her daughter who had left the abusive marriage on several occasions was swayed by appeals from her abusive husband because of her concern for their children. Expressing her concern, the First Lady stressed that no woman should endure such cruelty and urged victims to seek help and escape dangerous situations. She emphasized the importance of leaving an abusive marriage rather than dying in it. The First Lady firmly stated that the abusive husband would face legal consequences for his actions, as the crime committed was against the state and could not be resolved through arbitration or appeals. Drawing attention to the resources available through the Ministry of Gender, the First Lady assured the public that there are avenues to address issues of spousal battery and prevent them from escalating. She also emphasized that no person, regardless of status or influence, has the right to abuse their spouse. POLL Marriage, she said, should be a source of happiness and fulfillment, not a prison sentence. In a gesture of support, she assured Mrs. Okhiria that she will receive assistance in obtaining a prosthetic arm to alleviate the loss she has suffered. The victim’s husband, Mr Jason has been arrested and is currently in Police custody.
