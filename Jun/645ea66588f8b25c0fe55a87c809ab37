Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, has described the sudden demise of media entrepreneur and owner of Daar Commu­nication Plc, High Chief Ray­mond Aleogho Dokpesi, as a big loss to the Nigerian media in­dustry and the country at large. The Bayelsa governor, in a condolence message to the Dok­pesi family, the management and staff of Daar Communi­cation through his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Daniel Alabrah, said Nigeria lost a media path­finder, passionate patriot, an unassuming bridge-builder and consummate administrator. Diri said the late Dokpe­si left indelible marks in the broadcast media through his pioneering efforts as well as in politics. “Dokpesi is fondly remem­bered for his candour, his unas­suming personality and cour­age in his pioneering initiative in private broadcast media. “He left a mark as an icon in the democratisation of the me­dia in Nigeria and as one who broadened the space for free speech among citizens. “Dokpesi was also noted for his strength of character and ability to build strong bridges of unity. He was a man who cherished and respected friendship either in politics or in business.” Diri prayed that members of his family and business empire would accept the loss as the will of God and that the Almighty would comfort them in this mo­ment of grief.
