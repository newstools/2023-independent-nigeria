Regardless of what happens on the final day match between Rivers United and Enyimba FC, both sides are guaranteed continental tickets in either CAF Champions League or CAF Confederation Cup respectively. With eight points each, the only other club that can top them on final match day is Remo Stars, who are currently 3rd with 6 points. As it is as at Friday, Lobi Stars and Sunshine Stars have next season to dream of continental engagements, with two points each from four matches and even if they win their final day matches, they can only have five points. The colour of the final continental ticket will be determined in the cracker between Bendel Insurance (3pts) and Remo Stars (6pts). A draw is enough for Remo Stars to return to the continent, while insurance must beat Remo to grab the only remaining continental jackpot.
