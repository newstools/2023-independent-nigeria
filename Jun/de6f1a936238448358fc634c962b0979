AWKA – The contender to the Amanuke Chieftaincy tussle, Chief Dennis Ezebuilo was on Tuesday granted bail to the sum of N10 million. Ezebuilo first appeared in court last week Thursday when he was accused of portraying himself as the traditional ruler of the Amanuke community while knowing the claim to be false and thereby committing an offence punishable under section 19 (C) of the Traditional Rulers Law No.14 of 1981 of Anambra State. He was also charged with committing a similar offence contrary to section 14 of the Traditional Rulers Law of 1987 and 2019. He was refused bail when he appeared before Justice Charles Okaa of the Anambra High Court on tge ground that he had evaded court appearances previously. But when he appeared in court on Tuesday his counsel Kenneth Onyekachi Ezeiyi moved a motion which he filed on June 15 accompanied by an affidavit requesting for Ezebuilo’s bail. The prosecutor,  Stanley Nwodo argued that sentiment and law don’t go together and that what matters is that the defendant attends court sessions. He also said nobody should treat the court with levity and that the judge should be respected. In his ruling, the court granted Ezebuilo bail in the sum of N10 million with two sureties one of who must have attained the rank of director in the civil service while the other must own a landed property within the jurisdiction of the court. POLL Furthermore, the sureties must show evidence of tax clearance for the past three years. He thereafter adjourned the hearing for September 14. Speaking to reporters after the court session, Ezebuilo’s counsel, Ezeiyi said though the bail condition is stringent they will meet it. He said Ezebuilo has almost got his freedom and promised to go back to the court based on the ruling. He recalled that he filed an application for Ezebuilo’s bail on September 15 but the court in its wisdom refused to take the bail application. “Today, the court has graciously granted bail to Ezebuilo,” he concluded.
