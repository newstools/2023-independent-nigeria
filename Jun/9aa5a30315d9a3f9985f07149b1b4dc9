ABUJA  – Concerned Citizens for Good Leadership and Sustainable De­velopment Initiative (CCUGLS­Di), a non-governmental organi­zation, has stated that the 10th Senate needs an honest, transpar­ent, fair-minded, result-oriented, and competent Senate president. The group through the secre­tary of the organizing committee, Dan’asabe Sulaiman Kakanda, who made this known in Abu­ja, described Dr. Abubakar Ab­dulaziz Yari as the only person among other candidates who possesses such attributes to lead the 10th Assembly leadership because he also possesses the acumen and charisma to ensure a united and pro-active senate for Nigerians. Kakadan said that the group whose sole objective is to enlight­en the citizenry on the need to have sound leadership and good governance for Nigeria, decided to endorse Yari because of the love they have for Nigerians. The statement reads: “As you are all aware, the 10th Assembly will be inaugurated on Tuesday, June 13, 2023, and in line with the objectives of our organization on the need to achieve effective and efficient leadership and good governance for our dear country Nigeria, we can analyze, assess and deliberate on the compet­itiveness of all the contenders aspiring for the seat of the Senate President. “From our analysis, we have found that there is no better can­didate to steer the realm of affairs of the 10th Assembly other than the distinguished Senator Dr. Ab­dullaziz Abubakar Yari to ensure that the Nigerian aspiration for good government is achieved. “The organization has found the distinguished senator best fit for the Senate Presidency, be­cause of his loyalty and consis­tency as an opposition party till date as ruling party. He has stood his feet on the ground for the par­ty through thick and thin, come rain, come shine,” he said.
