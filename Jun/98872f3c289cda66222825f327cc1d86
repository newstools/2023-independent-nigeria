EFFURUN – The All Progressives Con­gress (APC) has ratified the expulsion of former mem­ber of House of Represen­tatives and chieftain of the party, Dr. Cairo Ojougboh, for alleged anti-party activ­ities in Delta State. Recall that Dr. Ojougboh was expelled from the APC fol­lowing his alleged unethical conduct during the February 25 presidential and March 18, 2023 governorship elections which was later nullified through the national legal adviser of the APC, Ahmad El- Marzuq. But few days after El-Mar­zuq overturned the sack, the state chapter of the party pro­vided empirical evidences of alleged culpability of Ojoug­boh, the party again, through El-Marzuq, ratified the ex­pulsion of Cairo Ojougboh, stating that the final decision was arrived at after new facts emerged. Addressing journalists in Effurun, Uvwie Local Gov­ernment Area of Delta State, Valentine Onojeghwo, the publicity secretary of the par­ty in Delta State, told journal­ists that Ojougboh remains suspended. Onojeghwo, who was sur­rounded by the APC state sec­retary, Peter Akarogbe, and the special leader of the party, Mudiaga Okorefe, said the let­ter from the party’s national legal adviser had confirmed that Ojougboh was no longer a member of the APC in Del­ta State, adding, “Dr. Cairo is gone as fuel subsidy is gone.” The letter by El-Marzuq made available to journal­ists, stated that the expul­sion of Ojougboh from the party was valid based on his violation of APC’s constitu­tion by filing an action in court against the party and establishing an illegal par­allel executive committee to carry out his machinations aimed at destabilising the party.
