Nollywood actress and filmmaker, Ufuoma Mcdermott has taken time to celebrate Chef Lata Tondon, the previous holder of the Guiness World Record for the longest time spent cooking. In an Instagram post, Mcdermott said that she chose to celebrate Chef Tondon for lighting a path for Hilda Baci to follow. Chef Tondon is an Indian from Madhya Pradesh who set the Guinness record for longest cook-a-thon in September 2019 after cooking for 87 hours, 45 minutes. “Today I choose to celebrate an inspiration @cheflatatondon Because she did, our awesome Hilda Baci could. Lata, you lit a torch to light a path and now many can see on that path. First woman to hold a Guinness World Record for the longest cooking by an individual is no mean feat. “Please forgive our overt excitement. We simply wanted our own to “win”. But even our own has acknowledged that you were the inspiration for the journey. Your title is NEVER lost. Posterity will remember that you were the first woman and you held it for a longtime. “In the same vein today, Hilda is inspiring many others. Keep speaking to young people about their dreams. Keep encouraging them. Because indeed, you are a beautiful inspiration,” she wrote. POLL In March 2023, Baci announced she would be attempting the record for the longest cooking marathon. On May 11, she started her record attempt. She broke the record on May 15 after cooking for 100 hours non-stop. In June, following a thorough review of all the evidence, Guinness announced Baci as the new record holder but reduced her cooking hours to 93 hours 11 minutes for a glitch in timing on her part. Hilda’s winning tweet by Guinness World Record has also been declared as the best-performing tweet so far by the body with nearly 30 million news feeds reached.
