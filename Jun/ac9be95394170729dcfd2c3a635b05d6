A new Commissioner of Police, CP Gyogon Augustine Grimah has taken over the Cross River State Command. Speaking with journalists on Friday in his office in Calabar, the new CP said he has been “duly briefed on the security architecture of the state and had strategically mapped out robust onslaught on intelligence-driven policing, deployment of officers and men for visibility policing. The new CP said, “In a bid to actualise these, I have directed the introduction of information boxes to be placed at strategic public places at Area Command Headquarters/ Divisional Headquarters level to enable members of the public to pass security information to the police undercover. Grimah added, “It is crystal clear that police personnel alone cannot accomplish the set goals without the collaborative efforts of members of the public. I want to reassure residents and unsuspecting persons to continue their good works in crime fighting through information dissemination to the police devoid of betrayal or any unpleasant consequences. “It is also worthy to note that modem policing methodology requires a complementary role through citizen’s participation in all the nooks and crannies, irrespective of the geographical location.” He called for the support of “traditional institutions, community leaders, and religious/youth leaders to see security as a collaborative business in addressing all forms of awful crimes across the state, especially now that a new government is in place.” He also warned criminals and those who unlawfully possess firearms to voluntarily surrender them in line with the amnesty window provided by the state government, adding that “Anything contrary will attract dare consequences and prosecution.”
