ABUJA -Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Tuesday, dismissed a suit filed by five residents of the Federal Capital Territory, seeking to stop the May 29, swearing in of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/578/2023, was filed by Chucks Nwachukwu, on behalf of the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs are Anyaegbunam Ubaka Okoye, David Aondover Adzer; Jeffrey Oheobeh Uche; Usang Paul, and Chibuike Nwachukwu, who sued for themselves and as representing other residents and registered voters of the FCT. Delivering judgment on the suit, Justice Ekwo ordered the Plaintiffsâ€™ lawyer, Chucks Nwachukwu to pay a fine of N10 million each to the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, and the Chief Justice of Nigeria, for constituting an abuse of court process. The court held that it lacked the jurisdiction to entertain the suit because the issue for determination was predicated on an election matter, which only the Presidential Election Petition Court can hear.
