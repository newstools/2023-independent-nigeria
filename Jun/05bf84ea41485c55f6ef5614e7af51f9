A Chieftain of All Progressive Congress in Plateau State and former Comptroller of Nigeria Customs Service David Victor Dimka has called on Nigerians to give President Bola Ahmed Tinubu administration more time to fix Nigeria on the part of growth and development. Dimka a former Governorship Aspirant in Plateau State in an interview with Daily Independent, said for Nigeria to get out of the mess in the economy that the present administration inherited, government institutions should be strengthened from its present weak status. According to Dimka, President Tinubu he knows is just one man who, if saddled with any responsibility, doesn’t fail going by his past records of achievements in Lagos and on the Nigerian political scene. He added that ‘” Tinubu has a vision for Nigeria and should be given enough time to execute his programs and vision for Nigeria to get us out of the woods'” Dimka stressed. He advised that since Dangote Refinery in Lagos has the capacity to produce what Nigerians need for local consumption when it goes into full operation this year, the government could decide to sell off the moribund refineries or go into Public Private Partnership (PPP) to put under check the corruption in the oil sector. Dimka a security expert also suggested that the only way the government could address the current security challenges in the country is for Government to consider the use of technology to fight all forms of acts of criminality in parts of the country. According to Dimka, ‘”The government should use real-time intelligence to take out crisis merchants from troubled Communities in the country for peace to return to the affected areas” Dimka stressed.
