The Imo State Government has announced plans to reposition medical tourism through Public Private Partnership (PPP), as well as eliminate quackery in its health sector. This, the government said is to accelerate the provision of qualitative health care delivery services for the people. The plans were revealed by the Commissioner for Health, Dr Success Prosper Ohayagha during an interview with newsmen led by the Special Adviser (Networking), Chantel Adanna Chinyere On­wuzuruike. According to Dr Ohayagha, the government’s zero tolerance on quackery in all life-saving in­stitutions in the state necessitated regular facility inspection at these establishments by government officials to ensure that they en­gage professionals, operate with government-approved licenses with accreditation, and are in a conducive environment to serve the people. The Commissioner warned that institutions found guilty of quackery would be closed and the proprietor arrested and prosecut­ed in accordance with the provi­sions of the law. Dr Ohayagha, who is a Special­ist in Reproductive Health and a fellow of the Institute of Manage­ment Consultant said that while the Health Insurance Scheme is being pursued with greater vigour, all private health establishments are now being monitored to en­sure that they do not deviate from government’s guidelines, rules and regulations for operation. He said: “We apply due intel­ligence and we work in synergy with the Nigerian Medical Asso­ciation (NMA) and we appreciate the support and cooperation of some international agencies such as the UNICEF.” He added that patent medicine dealers and traditional medicine practitioners who live up to gov­ernment expectations would con­tinue to be appreciated by the Gov­ernment while those who perform below expectations will continue to face sanctions. He disclosed that a number of the 305 healthcare centres in the local government areas had been renovated just as those abandoned by previous administrations are now being revived.
