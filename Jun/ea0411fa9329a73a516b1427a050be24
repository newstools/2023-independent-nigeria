Ahead of the Inauguration of the 10th Senate on June 13, one of the contenders for the Senate Presidency and former governor of Akwa-Ibom state, Godswill Akpabio seems to be having a tough time. Some Senators, who had earlier expressed support for him are reportedly withdrawing on account of issues connected with his relationship with the National Assembly when he was Minister of the Nigeria Delta. It was, however, gathered that his Campaign Organisation is now making frantic pleas to senators-elect on behalf of Senator Akpabio. Recall that the Deputy Director-General of Akpabio/ Barau Campaign Organisation, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, (APC), Ekiti Central, was quoted to have told the Media on Monday that the campaign is appealing to senators-elect to support Akpabio’s bid. Some of the senators-elect hinted that they are having a rethink on Sen. Akpabio’s Senate Presidency over accusations that he was disrespectful to the institution of the legislature when he, as the Minister of Niger Delta, openly accused National Assembly members of hugely benefiting from large contracts in the NDDC without a proof. A senator-elect who pleaded anonymity confirmed the withdrawal of support for Sen. Akpabio querying how he can preside over the National Assembly he despised. He said: “I have withdrawn support for Senator Akpabio. It’s not only me. Many of us have withdrawn our support and it will show on the floor. “I used to have very high regard for Senator Akpabio as a person but I can’t support him to be the Senate President. POLL “How can he (Akpabio) come and preside over an institution which he once described as a cesspit of corruption after benefitting from the same institution.”
