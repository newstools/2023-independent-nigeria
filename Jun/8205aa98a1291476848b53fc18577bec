Mr. Kolawole is a male hairstylist in Ogun State. He is the founder of Kays Touch and has always been interested in hair beautification since when he was little. In this interview with TUNMISE PHILLIPS, he spoke about the future dreams he has in a female-dominated profession and the challenges he faces as a male hairstylist. Excerpts: How many years have you been in the business? I have been in the hair business for over five years. This included the period of apprenticeship. How did you develop an interest in a female-like business? Actually, I have always been interested in hair making since I was a child. At first, I learned how to do barbering. But I wanted something that will make me unique; something that will make me different from others and stand out. So, I decided that since I love making hair, let me just go and train for it and I did. What challenges do you face as a male hairstylist? The challenges are not numerous but one of the major challenges I face is the insecurities of most of my clientsâ€™ spouses. They probably feel while making their hair I indirectly want to have something sensual to do with their woman or if it is a promiscuous woman that will allow a man to make her hair. Meanwhile, I am just doing my job and being professional at it. I have a lot of clients who stopped patronizing me all because of their spouses. How do you overcome these challenges? POLL I try as much as possible to be professional and maintain a stylist/client relationship, nothing aside from that. How profitable is the business? It is very profitable. The amount I charge my clients is always worth the services. What are your long-term goals for the business? My long-term goals are numerous, but one of them is working for influential and wealthy people. I want to be a known brand that styles influential people all over. Moreover, I want to be one of the best hairstylists in Africa.
