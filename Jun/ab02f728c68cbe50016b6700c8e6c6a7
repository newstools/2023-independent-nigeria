Liverpool appear to be working quickly on strengthening their squad for next season after having announced the departure of four first-team players and also allowing loanee Arthur Melo to re-join Juventus after a failed loan spell. Romano adds that the Reds have reached total agreement with Mac Allister on a five-year contract that will be valid until June 2028. It is also stated that the Merseyside giants will be paying a fee of substantially less than £60 million, which had been rumoured to be the amount Brighton would ask for him. Romano also adds that Liverpool have already booked the Argentine midfielder to undergo his medical tests with them in the next 24-48 hours as they aim to wrap up this deal as soon as possible and ensure that Mac Allister is able to start the pre-season campaign with them in July. The 24-year-old midfielder managed to take the Premier League by storm in the 2022/23 season and played a pivotal role in helping Brighton manage a top-7 finish, ensuring that they will be playing in the UEFA Europa League for the first time in their history next season. Mac Allister, who was hailed as a ‘very intelligent player’ by Sergio Aguero for the important role he played for Argentina in their Qatar World Cup campaign, scored 10 goals and provided two assists in 35 league appearances for the Seagulls. He is recognized as a hard-working, energetic midfielder who can adapt to different roles – and also possesses an eye for goal and creating chances from midfield.
