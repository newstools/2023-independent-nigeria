ABUJA  – The Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) has alleged that there are plans to block lawmak­ers-elect opposed to the Senate Presidency’s ambition of God­swill Akpabio from gaining ac­cess to the National Assembly on the day of the inauguration of the 10th National Assembly. A statement on Sunday issued by Abdul-Azeez Sulei­man, CNG Spokesperson, also expressed worry that some el­ements bent on smearing the good relationship of President Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the North,are hatching plans to get key northern as­pirants to the House of Repre­sentatives speakership as well as the aspirants to the Senate Presidency such as Alhaji Ab­dulaziz Yari and some of his strong support pillars arrested and intimidated out of the con­test for insisting on due process. Suleiman said the plot also extends to aspirants to positions in the House of Representatives who are targeted for harassment and intimidation. He said the plot, as widely speculated, involves the intro­duction of a suspicious electron­ic voting system in the process meant to track the pattern of voting in the National Assembly. The CNG explained that it is worried by its sincere con­viction that these elements are hatching these evil plans with­out the consent of Mr President, with the sole aim of pitching him against the larger northern interest. “CNG is, without the slightest doubt, convinced that by Tinu­bu’s democratic antecedents and abiding faith in the rule of law and sanctity enfranchisement, Mr President shall never be par­ty to any conduct that tends to impeach anybody’s right to per­sonal liberty and freedom from harassment.”
