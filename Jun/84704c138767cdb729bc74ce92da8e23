ABUJA – The Presidential Election Petition Court sitting at the Court of Appeal Abuja, on Friday admitted more exhibits from the Labour Party and its presidential candidate, Peter Obi. Obi and LP are challenging the victory of Bola Tinubu in the February 25, presidential election at the PEPC, on the grounds that it was grossly rigged against them, in favour of Tinubu, and his party, the All Progressives Congress. On Thursday, the petitioners had tendered exhibits from six States comprising Rivers, Benue, Cross River, Niger, Osun and Ekiti States. However, at Friday’s proceedings, Obi and Labour Party tendered exhibits from six other States including Adamawa Bayelsa, Oyo, Edo, Lagos and Akwa Ibom. The exhibits comprising mainly forms EC8A used in the February 25, presidential election and certified by the National Electoral Commission as true copies of the original were admitted as exhibits. A breakdown of the fresh exhibits showed that forms EC8A from 21 Local Government Areas of Adamawa, 8 in Local Government Areas of Bayelsa, 31 Local Government Areas of Oyo, 18 Local Government Areas of Edo, 20 Local Government Areas of Lagos and 31 Local Government Areas of Akwa Ibom, were duly tendered and admitted in evidence by the PEPC. Meanwhile, Tinubu, APC and INEC, all respondents in the petition told the court that they would challenge the admissibility of the documents at the final stage of address. At the close of Friday’s proceedings, Peter Afoba SAN, who represented the petitioners, informed the Court that they have exhausted the documents at their disposal for the day. POLL Afoba applied to the Court to consider the admitted documents as read but the request was opposed by all respondents in the matter. Further hearing in the petition has been slated for Monday, June 5.
