Jose Mourinho is not only ready to remain at Roma, but also extend his contract to June 2026, according to the latest reports in Italy. The coach had repeatedly raised doubts over his future, insisting the club needed to give him more resources to work with, even while staying within the Financial Fair Play parameters. The situation shifted following a meeting with the club owners, the Friedkin family, but also the fact Paris Saint-Germain pulled out of talks with the Special One, as the Qatari hierarchy did not consider him to be a suitable fit for the Ligue 1 side. Nonetheless, the Corriere dello Sport claim there are negotiations now to not only remain for the third and final year of his contract, but to extend it until 2026. Mourinho won the Conference League in his first season, then reached the Europa League Final, losing only in a penalty shoot-out to Sevilla.
