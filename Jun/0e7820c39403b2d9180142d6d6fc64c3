The High Court of Justice sitting at Otor-Udu, headquarters of Udu local government area of Delta state has granted an interim injunction restraining PWAN Plus Business Concerns Ltd, Chief Magamu, Chief Matthew Uparan, Chief Saiki William and other unknown persons interested in selling, investing or doing business with all DSC lands described as Delta 11 site in survey plan with plan number DSC/M/2011 to desist from such acts forthwith. The order was granted by Honourable Justice R.D Harriman (Mrs) on Thursday, June 1, 2023, upon a motion filed by Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria and Premium Steel and Mines Limited, owners of the old Delta Steel Company, Ovwian-Aladja. The order explicitly stated that the defendants and any unknown investors or land speculators are barred from ‘’clearing, felling trees, erecting or continuing to erect or build any structure thereon pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice, AND for such further order or other orders as this Honourable Court may deem fit to make in the circumstances.’’ A Premium Steel and Mines Limited source disclosed that the company resorted to going to court to secure the company assets and that whoever may dare the powers of the court may end up buying nothing or at best litigations as AMCON and PSML are not willing to concede an inch of the company assets to illegal speculators and investors. ‘’The general public is hereby warned to stay away from those land situated at the DSC site II on the way to the steel plant and other DSC lands and assets wherever they may be’’, the source from the legal unit of PSML added.
