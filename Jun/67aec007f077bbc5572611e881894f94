In order to identify and widely recognise private and public enterprises, as well as institu­tions that have contributed to the development of Nigeria’s economy, the Business Execu­tive Media Group and its sub­sidiary, NG Buzz Executive Limited, have concluded plans to hold its maiden edition of Ni­geria hemisphere awards. The awards, which would come under the theme: “Re-en­gineering the economy for post-elections growth in Nige­ria, is a regional one which com­prises the six geo-political zones of the country. A statement signed and made available to the media by the CEO of the Business Ex­ecutive Media Group, Baron­ess Paulette Kporo, explained that the award winners would emerge from all the regions with different categories in health, education, real estate, among others. Kporo also said that the theme of the awards, which is scheduled to hold in Abuja on the 23rd of June, 2023, would cre­ate an opportunity for different sectors of the economy in the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria to network and interact so as to understand the challenges they faced in their different regions before the election.
