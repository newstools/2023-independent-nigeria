ABUJA – The Kano State government and people deserve praise for recently passing the Child Protection Law, which former governor Umar Abdullahi Ganduje signed into law. The Kano State Child Protection Law is a wonderful accomplishment that benefits the children and residents of Kano, according to Mr. Rahama R.M. Farah, Chief of UNICEF Field Office Kano. It creates a legal framework to guarantee the state’s observance of children’s rights. Now that the law has been established, it is essential to allot the required funds and set up procedures for its efficient execution. We urge the new administration in Kano State to take this vital step and provide adequate resources to ensure the comprehensive enforcement of the law,” Mr. Farah added. With the enactment of this law, Kano State joins other states that have successfully incorporated the Nigeria Child Rights Act, originally enacted by the National Assembly in 2003, into their legal frameworks. It is important to note that this Act is derived from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), of which Nigeria is a signatory. Extensive consultations were conducted with key stakeholders, including faith-based and community leaders, during the development of the bill. This collaborative effort ensured that the law reflects the values and aspirations of the people of Kano.
