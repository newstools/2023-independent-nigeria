A conference involving over 50 Bishops and 1,000 Pastors has kicked off on Friday, 2nd June 2023 at the Cathedral of the Christos International Worship Centre, Apo Area of Abuja. The three-day conference, from the 2nd to the 4th of June, with the theme Building The Man Behind The Pulpit, A Time of Refreshing For Min­isters/Leaders is part of the Christos yearly God of June 11 Celebration, when the Head Pastor and General Overseer of Christos, Bishop David Nwachukwu Ogudu received his call from the Almighty into the ministry. According to a statement from Rev. Esther Chibuikem, Head of Media for Christos International Worship Centre, Bishop Ogudu wants to use the conference to “re-equip, re­fresh, rearm, and rebuild the Pastors for the work they do.” He said that “many people do not know that a Pastor’s life could be lonely despite the teeming crowd he shepherds. He explained that many Pas­tors are struggling against dif­ferent problems but find little empathy even from the persons close and that many Pastors also experience burnout be­cause of the round-the-clock work they do and the burden they bear – without complaint and with little or no time for relaxation. Sometimes what could save a burnt-out pastor from a major health challenge such as a stroke or heart attack is just to know when and how to relax.”
