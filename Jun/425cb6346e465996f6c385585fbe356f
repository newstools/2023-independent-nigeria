Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU) has just suspended its 12-day-old strike with a caveat to review it after 21 days. JOHESU in a statement signed by Mathew Ajurotu, its acting National Secretary, stated that JOHESU called off its strike after a one-hour meeting with President Bola Tinubu who pledged to respond to the union’s demands after due consultation. Specifically, JOHESU reportedly said that President Tinubu promised to give approval to its demands after further consultations with appropriate quarters in government. The statement reads, “JOHESU has just suspended its strike with a caveat to review it after 21 days. “We met President Tinubu today at a one-hour parley and he promised to give approval to the demands after further consultations with appropriate quarters in government.” Independent Newspapers learnt that President Tinubu urged JOHESU to call off its ongoing indefinite strike during a meeting with the union’s leadership on Monday. Independent Newspapers had earlier reported that members of JOHESU commenced an indefinite nationwide strike on May 25. The health workers started the strike to compel the government to pay their hazard allowances and meet the salary structure adjustment, among other demands. POLL JOHESU had earlier issued a 15-day strike ultimatum to the Federal Government effective from May 10. The deadline elapsed on May 25, before JOHESU embarked on a nationwide indefinite strike, accusing the Federal Government of breaching its promise to meet its welfare demands. However, in the discussion with the union, Tinubu pledged to expedite the JOHESU demands and address any outstanding problems, Ajurotu said.
