The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has reiterated the need for multisectoral effort and technological innovations to protect the environment, call­ing on stakeholders to continue to explore innovations to solve pressing environmental chal­lenges. The governor said this in commemoration of World En­vironment Day marked every year by the United Nations and its sister agencies. In a statement, the governor noted that this year’s theme for the World Environment Day, Solutions to Plastic Pollution, is apt and relevant, as it stresses the increasing need for collec­tive action to stem the menace of plastic pollution in the wake of rapid industrialization. According to him: “As we mark the World Environment Day today, we are presented with another opportunity to review actions and efforts taken over the years to protect the environ­ment, build alliances, deploy technological innovations and ensure that we leave this world better for unborn generations. “The menace of plastic pol­lution is exacerbated by human activity and as we continue to grow, as urbanisation spreads and the industries continue to expand, the more we are likely to have plastic pollution. “This is why we need to strengthen multi-sectoral efforts to address the challenges of plas­tic pollution.” The governor noted that in Edo State, efforts are being intensified to build a coalition between local communities, Civil Society Organisations and government bodies to clean and green the environment and address environmental issues.
