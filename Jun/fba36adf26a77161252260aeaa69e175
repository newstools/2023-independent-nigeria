LAGOS – The All Progressives Congress Plateau State Chapter has commended the observance of the rule of law as provided by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, no matter whose ox is gored on the dissolution of the local government councils in Plateau State. Spokesman of the Party Sylvanus Namang in a statement in Jos on Friday made available to Daily Independent said the Party in Plateau State is particularly full of gratitude to the Inspector General of Police over the directive to the Plateau Police Commissioner ordering the immediate sealing of the 17 Local Government Secretariats in Plateau State in order to prevent a break down of law and order in the State as a result of the ill-informed dissolution of the Local Government elected Chairmen and the Legislative Arms in the third tier of Government by Governor Caleb Mutfwang. According to him,'”The APC also commends the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba for his swift directive to the Commissioner of Police, Plateau State Command, CP Bartholomew Onyeka to ensure the implementation of the directive without delay”. “The APC had condemned in strong terms the illegal dissolution of Local Government structures in the State only two days after Governor Mutfwang’s assumption of the Governorship of the State and the appointment of Interim Chairman for the 17 Local Government and their nocturnal swearing-in irrespective of a subsisting Jos High Court injunction”. He said the Party and the good people of Plateau State have heaved a deep sigh of relief over the curbing the excesses of the Pateau State Government which has ascended to power with a vindictive mindset instead of seeking the Federal Government’s assistance and collaboration to curb the incessant insecurity which has led to the loss of precious lives of our citizens and destruction of property with the recent ones being in Mangu the Governor’s Local Government of origin. While commending the police for implementing the directive to it, the APC in the State also humbly appeal to the Commissioner of Police to go beyond the sealing of the Local Government Secretariats and execute the subsisting court order restraining Governor Mutfwang from tampering or interfering with democratically-elected structures at the grassroots. Namang said APC is appealing to its teeming members and supporters to remain calm in the face of the unprovoked acts of the state government and allow the law to take its course.
