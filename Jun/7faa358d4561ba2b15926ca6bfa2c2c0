LAGOS – Lion Oluwatoyin Omotola Ipaye, Charter President 2022-2023 for Sunshine Lion Club, has estimated the total cost of projects to be embarked upon within the service year to be N10million. Ipaye dropped this hint while speaking at her official charter presentation and fundraising ceremony as the chartered president of Lagos Sunshine Lion Club along with the installation of the new members to the club. She said that the main reason for the gathering was to officially inaugurate the club and her officers into the association and to also raise funds towards specific valuable projects and upcoming activities as part of the vision and mission of the Lions Club. Lion Ipaye also stated that in the last few months, the members have been participating in both financial and physical activities both at the District and Club level such as hunger relief programme, which is one of club’s Global Cause at Pen Cinema, Agege, where 500 people smiled home with one bag of rice each. “While our major focus will be in alignment with five Global Causes of Lions International, which are diabetes, vision, environment, hunger and childhood cancer, based on these five pillars, we intend to raise funds today to enable us to execute some projects and activities.” The programmes and activities, according to her, include: organize hunger relief programme, childhood cancer awareness and donations of equipment to the cancer unit, awareness walk, screening and cataract surgery, donation of cleaning equipment and planting of tree and awareness programme for diabetics patients in a public place on how to adjust their lifestyle in managing diabetes.
