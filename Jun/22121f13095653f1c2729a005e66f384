Roma have reportedly reached agreements with Houssem Aouar and Evan Ndicka, but José Mourinho is reportedly looking for more free agents, including Wilfred Zaha and Youri Tielemans. The Giallorossi are already preparing for 2023-24 and are expected to announce the signings of Aouar and Ndicka in the coming weeks. The midfielder’s transfer is done and sealed, while Ndicka is said to be very close to completing a free transfer to the Stadio Olimpico. CM.com reported on Wednesday that the Eintracht defender has already shaken hands with Tiago Pinto. It’s not all, as Roma are looking for more free signings. According to Thursday’s printed edition of La Gazzetta dello Sport (page 23), Crystal Palace striker Zaha is in Mourinho’s sights and is one of the candidates to replace the injured Tammy Abraham. It’s not the first time Zaha has been linked with a move to the Stadio Olimpico, but Mauro Icardi and Mbala Nzola appear to be higher on Roma’s agenda. As per Il Corriere dello Sport (page 18), Tielemans is another potential free signing for the Giallorossi. The Belgian’s contract expires this coming June and he’s expected to leave following Leicester City’s relegation from the Premier League.
