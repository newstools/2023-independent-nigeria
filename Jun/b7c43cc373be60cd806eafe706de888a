ABUJA  – The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has adopted the National Minimum Tol­erable score for admission into universities at 140. It also adopted 100 for both Polytechnics and Colleges of Education respectively. The JAMB Registrar, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, read out the min­imum scores at the 2023 Policy Meeting of Tertiary Institutions in Nigeria on Saturday. He said that all institutions must abide by this rule and must not go below the approved points. He also said that every ter­tiary institution must ensure its own minimum standard, espe­cially as it relates to institution­al screening and grading in the Senior Secondary Certificate Ex­amination (SSCE), which must not be lower than 50 marks. ”All institutions must abide by this minimum point. This means that no institution can go below the standard. ”For the 15 private universities that demanded between 120 and 130 as minimum points, note that the 140 is sacrosanct and must not be violated. “This is because the system put in place will not recognise 139, so ensure you comply,” he said. POLL Oloyede also said that institu­tions must not collect more than N2,000 as screening fees from candidates.
