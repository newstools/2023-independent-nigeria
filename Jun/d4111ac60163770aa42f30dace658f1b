The telecommunica­tions and Informa­tion Services sector in Nigeria has, in the first quarter of 2023, de­livered a handsome N2.508 trillion in terms of finan­cial value contribution to the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP), representing 14.13 per cent. Figures released by the National Bureau of Statis­tics (NBS) showed that the sector recorded a 4.3 percent increase from its perfor­mance in the last quarter of 2022 when it recorded 13.55 percent. When compared on a year-on-year basis, the growth showed a positive progres­sion from 12.94 percent in the first quarter of 2022, to the 2023 figure of 14.13, which is an approximate growth of 9.19 percent. The percentage of tele­com contribution to GDP was calculated from 46 dis­tinct sectors of the economy, which constitute telecom and information services baskets. The Nigerian telecom industry has continued its show of positive outlook, which is credited to the inno­vative and predictable tele­com regulatory environment promoted, and implemented by the Nigerian Communi­cations Commission (NCC). One of the key highlights of the telecom industry per­formance within the period was the generation of $820.8 Million for the federal gov­ernment from 5G spectrum license fees paid by three eventual winning operators, MTN, MAFAB, and Airtel. Following the issuance of the licenses in Decem­ber 2021 to MTN and MA­FAB, both companies have launched 5G services. Airtel, which received its license in December 2022, is set to launch services this month, June 2023. Another major devel­opment in the sector was the launch of Starlinks broadband services, a sat­ellite-based wireless broad­band service with potential nationwide coverage. This followed the issuance of a license to Elon Musk-owned SpaceX by the Commission. The services are now avail­able in different parts of the country. POLL Meanwhile, the growth statistics of the telecom industry are showing an impressive record of contri­butions to the economy. The number of phone subscrib­ers as of April 2023, stood at 223.6 million subscribers, scoring a teledensity of 117 percent. Internet subscrib­ers for the same period were 157 million while Broadband subscriptions stood at 92 Mil­lion, translating to 48 per­cent broadband penetration in the country.
