Surveyors in Ogun State, especially young ones, have been charged to uphold the ethics of the profession by building on the foundation laid by the elders in the profession. This came to the fore at a dinner, tagged ‘OgunNight’ organised by Ogun surveyors to commemorate 2023 National Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Nigeria Institution of Surveyors (NIS). The dinner which held at 3J’s Hotel, Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory, had surveyors in Ogun State and their wives who are members of the Surveyors Wives Association of Nigeria (SWAN), gathered to brainstorm on the way forward of the profession and also to mingled with each other to foster love and unity. Speaking at the event, chairman of NIS, Ogun State branch, Surveyor Ademola Adebowale, and his counterpart in the Association of Private Practicing Surveyors of Nigeria (APPSN) in the state, Surveyor Kayode Adekoya, appreciated the efforts of the elders in the profession who they claimed had laid a solid foundation for the profession upon which upcoming surveyors were building. “If our elders in this profession had not done what they did in the past by laying a good and solid foundation for surveying in Ogun State, all of us will not be what we are today. “I am proud to let you know that Ogun surveyors are second to none. Other states wonder how we do it,” he said.
