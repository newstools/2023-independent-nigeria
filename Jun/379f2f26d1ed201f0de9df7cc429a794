Architect Olubunmi Komolafe Dickalo, sole sponsor of the Dickalo U 17 Football Competition, has asked grassroots coaches to be more forensic with youth recruitments to beat age cheats thereby marring soccer development and marketing in the country. He made the call at the Kwara Football Academy, KFA, where his competition kicked off on Friday at the academy pitch. “It’s very important academy owners and operators get it right from the start,” he said, explaining why he was insistent on stringent screening of players to fit the age brackets of eligible players. Performing the ceremonial kick off, the founder of Dickalo Football Academy and CEO Dickalo Nigeria Limited, said the tournament is solely aimed at scouting for talents from the grassroots for onward transfer to Dickalo Academy. Dickalo expressed confidence in the ability of the competition to achieve the target for which it was organised. He noted that the organisation will soon take shape as the championship progresses. In the match day one, Ilorin East won by a walk over Irepodun Local Government who failed to show up. Edu and Marcon of Ogbomosho FC played out a one all draw while Flash Bombers defeated Kingshood by two goals to nil. POLL Actions continue on Saturday.
