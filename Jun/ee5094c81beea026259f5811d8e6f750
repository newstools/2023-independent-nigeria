The leading global toothpaste brand, in collaboration with Nigeria Dental Association, NDA, and FDA, has kicked off its school activation program in primary schools across the nation to promote oral health education in Nigeria. The school activation program titled ‘Pepsodent Brush Day and Night School Program’ is targeted at educating and reaching a minimum of 2,000,000 pupils between the age of 6 and 11 in 6 states that include Lagos, Rivers, Enugu, Imo, Kaduna, and Edo. Speaking during the kick-off of the activation program held at St. Saviour Primary School in Lagos, Marketing Head, Beauty& Wellbeing and Personal Care, Unilever Nigeria Plc, Oiza Gyang, noted that the oral hygiene program has been designed to engage children in Primary schools for the next three months after which students will be rewarded for their full participation. Speaking on the mechanism of the 21-day challenge, Gyang stated that the activation would happen five days a week while the activation team would return after 21 days to reward students who complete the challenge. Studies have shown that behavioural change happens 21 days after repeated action. Oral conditions are among the world’s most widespread chronic diseases. In Nigeria, it is the leading cause of absenteeism among school children. “The whole idea about this challenge is to encourage young kids to imbibe the habits of good oral behavior. As you are aware, Oral health is critical to any individual’s well-being and productivity. ” We are passionate about families and children, and we believe that complete oral protection for the family is achievable. We believe that with this activation and the level of awareness we are creating, a lot of young pupils would see the significance of having good oral hygiene,” she said. She further stressed that the activation program aims to encourage oral behavioral change among young school kids, which would lead to their general well-being and good quality of life.
