The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Plateau State Chapter, Hon. Rufus Bature has felicitated with the Muslim Ummah in Plateau State as they join their counterparts in other parts of the world in celebrating this year’s Eid – El – Kabir Sallah. Bature in a press statement issued in Jos on Wednesday and made available to Daily Independent through the Party’s spokesman Sylvanus Namang, enjoins the Muslim faithful to see this very important festivity in the Islamic calendar which symbolises the sacrifice of Isma’il by Prophet Ibrahim to imbibe this cherished virtue of the Holy Prophet. According to him, this celebration now more than any period in Islamic tradition, calls for greater sacrifice for our children’s tomorrow which has been mindlessly squandered by past administrations but under President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, concerted efforts are being made to put our country once again on the path of progress. He calls on the Muslim brethren to use this auspicious occasion to foster peace, unity and brotherliness regardless of religious differences. The Plateau APC Chairman urged the Muslim Ummah to pray for the peace of Plateau state, especially at this period when several communities have come under a series of incessant attacks which have led to the loss of many precious lives and property. Hon. Rufus Bature wished the Muslim Ummah blissful and hitch-free Sallah celebrations.
