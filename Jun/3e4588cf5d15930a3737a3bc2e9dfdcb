Governor Sheriff Oborevwori of Delta State, on Monday, assured that his administration would continue funding ongoing projects across the state to ensure prompt completion. Oborevwori gave the assurance while speaking to journalists during inspection of the Sector ‘A’ and Sector ‘C’ of the Ughelli-Asaba Road dualisation project. At Sector ‘A’ of the project in Emevor, he commended the contractor for the pace of work being done, adding that the project was very dear to Deltans. He urged the contractor to put in more effort to ensure early completion of the project. “The contractor has assured us that the 42.5km Sector A would be completed within 18 months as long as we continue paying their certificates regularly. “Let me reiterate that this road is very key to all of us in Delta State, not only the Isoko people because this is the only road we use to access the state capital. “The road is very important to us and we want it completed as soon as possible and hence it’s the first inspection I am carrying out since I assumed office as governor. “This is the road I usually pass and I want you to keep to your promise. I appreciate the youths and people of Isoko for their support. POLL “The Isoko people are peace loving people; they want the project, all of us want the project too so it’s very key to us as a state and I will be coming from time to time to see the work being done. “We will continue to encourage the contractors to make sure they utilise the time to finish the dual carriageway before the rain starts.”
