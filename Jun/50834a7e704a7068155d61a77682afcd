Senator Ibrahim Mohammed Bomai representing Yobe South Senatorial District has urged the constituents to embrace peaceful coexistence and unity to accelerate more development in the area. The lawmakers made the plea while addressing his supporters at his residence shortly after his inauguration into the 10th assembly. He thanked them for their “hard work, commitment, resilience during my elections, your efforts are worthy of commendation because our senatorial district is believed that no Senator is voted twice, we thank God that today I have been returned to serve for the second time. I assure you that if we unite we will continue to win and deliver democracy dividends to our peace-loving people.” Bomai used the forum to forgive all those that worked against his success during the elections “You are all living witness to what has happened, all those that worked against our interest I have forgiven them, I extend them hands of fellowship to join us to meet the yearnings and aspirations of our people. By the grace of God, we will continue to deliver quality services, we will facilitate projects that will positively improve the lives of our people. “We just began the journey, we appreciate you and welcome everyone to our political journey, let’s maintain relationships, take things easy, you can see here people of different tribes and backgrounds joining us to develop our senatorial district. I have forgiven everyone and assured you of improvement.”
