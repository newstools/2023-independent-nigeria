Manchester City have agreed a £30m deal to sign Chelsea midfielder Mateo Kovacic. The fee is understood to be worth an initial £25m guaranteed plus £5m in performance-related add-ons. A formal announcement of Kovacic joining last season’s treble winners is expected soon. Kovacic has been at Stamford Bridge since joining from Real Madrid – initially on loan – in the summer of 2018. The Croatia international has won four major trophies during his time at Chelsea – including his fourth Champions League in 2021 – while going on to make 221 appearances for the club.
