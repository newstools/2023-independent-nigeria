LOKOJA – The Commander, 12 Bri­gade of the Nigerian Army, Brig. -Gen Isang Akpau­montia, has solicited the full cooperation and syn­ergy with the traditional institutions for total on­slaught against crimes and criminality in Kogi State. The Commander made the appeal when he paid a cour­tesy visit to Etsu Bassa-Nge Kingdom, HRM Alhaji Brig.- Gen. Abu Ali (rtd); and the Aguma of Bassa, HRM Jimba William Keke. Recall that the Army Com­mander had earlier paid cour­tesy visits to the Atta Igala, the Ohinoyi of Ebiraland and the Obaro of Kabba to seek their maximum support. In his short remarks at Bassa-Nge Kingdom, the Bri­gade Commander thanked the traditional ruler for the warm reception, describing the visit as a unique one be­ing a retired General in the Nigerian Army and now a royal father. General Akpaumontia said that the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt. Farouk Yahaya, dimmed it necessary to up­grade the Command Army (CAR) to 12 Brigade Head­quarters Nigerian Army, to enhance security in Kogi State. According to him, “As the commander, I decided to pay courtesy visits to traditional rulers across the state to seek your support and collabora­tions to boost security in the state, and to convey the good­will of the COAS to you and the people of Kogi. “We shall be coming to you from time to time to seek your fatherly counsel, advice and collaborations, which is the idea and initiative of the COAS to boosting security across the state and the nation at large.” The brigade commander assured the royal fathers of improved security across the state. POLL He, however, warned crim­inal elements in the state to turn a new leaf or move out of the state, stressing that it would never be business as usual. “It is going to be a different ball game entirely as there would be no safe haven any more for criminals in the state,” he added. In his response, the mon­arch welcomed the command­er and the respectable mem­bers of his entourage for the courtesy visit.
