A group, Frontier Ladies for Sheriff, has stated that with the few appoint­ments made so far and pro­grammes/projects tipped to embark on by the new governor of Delta State, Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori, the governor would deliv­er on his promised M.O.R.E Agenda. Okproko Ese Joyce, Mrs Anne Macaulay-Gbogidi and Joan Esheti, Coordinator, As­sistant Coordinator and Sec­retary of Frontier Ladies for Sheriff respectively, made this known on behalf of the group at Asaba during the special thanksgiving to mark the 60th birthday of the governor. The group stated that the governor has started in the right direction. Therefore, it was incumbent on them as Deltans to support him to achieve his vision. According to the group, “with Rt. Governor Sheriff Oborevwori on Delta’s dem­ocratic saddle, his M.O.R.E Agenda is a sure way to great­ness in all ramifications of na­tional development.” Frontier Ladies For Sher­iff is a support group of young and middle aged wom­en whose objectives, among others, were supporting women aspiring for elective positions and ensuring the girl-child gets educated. The women group has its political structures in the three senatorial districts and 25 LGAs of Delta State.
