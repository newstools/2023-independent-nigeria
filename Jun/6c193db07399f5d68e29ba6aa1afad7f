LAGOS – The MotorMechs and Technicians Association of Nigeria (MOMTAN) has thrown its support behind the decision of President Bola Tinubu to remove subsidy on petrol, adding that action was in the best interest of Nigerians in the long run. Speaking in an interview with Daily Independent on Thursday in Lagos, the national president of the association, Alhaji Maruf Arowolo, said that subsidy was not in the interest of a large majority of Nigerians. He said that Nigerians should face reality and accept the removal of subsidy on petrol, adding that the action will favour the masses. The president of MOMTAN described the subsidy regime as a fraud that was perpetrated against Nigerians by some powerful people in the country. According to him, the subsidy regime had plunged the nation into debt, adding funds saved from subsidy payments will be used to develop the economy and build critical infrastructure. He reiterated the association’s support for the Federal Government’s efforts to revitalize and reinvigorate the country’s economy. Arowolo urged Nigerians to support the Federal Government in its plan to make Nigeria a better place for all. He, however, called on the Federal Government to give priority to the automotive industry because of the critical role it plays in the development of the nation’s economy.
