Nigerian musician, Nikki Laoye has remembered her colleague and friend, the late Sammie Okposo on what would have been his 52nd birthday. In an Instagram post, the songstress stated that she was up at 4 am knowing it was the late singer’s birthday, crying and thinking about him. “How I can’t call you today or hear you laugh as you shout my name ‘Nikki Lee’. Na wa o, Bros. Still feels unreal that you are really not here anymore. Too many memories, Too many plans for this year and every day is a reminder that we can’t do them anymore. “You were My ever protective Big Brother and Friend. You always took care of me and looked out for me. You filled so many places in my life and now your absence is very loud. I miss our hangouts, I miss our 2-hour calls, you won’t even use wifi and call me on WhatsApp while I am in the UK, you will burn your credit and call my number directly and gist ooo,” she wrote. She further stated that many times lately, she needed his advice badly and I would try to imagine what the late Okposo would advise her to do at such times. “I am so glad that you saw your sister happy and in love again. You held my hands, wiped my tears when I lost my footing the 1st time and helped me to get back on my feet. Then you cancelled all your bookings in the USA, and flew down to be at our wedding in March 2022. “You kuku stayed at our wedding till we shut down the hall, you wouldn’t leave my side till we were done. That’s you, bro. You always carry me for head. I have just kept you in a special part of my heart that remembers you fondly and finds a way to move on, just the same way that i did with my Dad,” she added. The gospel singer and soundtrack producer passed on November 25, 2022 at 51. His burial took place at a private cemetery in Ikoyi, Lagos.
