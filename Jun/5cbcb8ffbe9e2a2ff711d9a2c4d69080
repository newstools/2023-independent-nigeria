ABUJA – The Social Democratic Party (SDP) has dismissed allega­tions of certificate forgery against its candidate ahead of the November 11 governorship election in Kogi State, Muritala Yakubu. The party disclosed a let­ter dated June 8, 2023, by the principal of Barewa College, Zaria, Yakubu Isyaku, which sought to correct an error con­tained in a similar letter earli­er addressed to the Chairman of Kogi East Council Forum, Chief Gabriel Yakubu Aduku. In the first letter, the college had debunked claims by the party’s governorship candidate that he attended the school. The principal, Alhassan Isyaku, in his response to the request stated, “Reference to your letter dated 30th May, 2023 for the above subject matter, I write to inform you that the above name was not a student of Barewa College Zaria. “After thorough investiga­tions in the following: (i) 1995 Admissions register; (ii) 1998 WAEC gazette; (iii) List of ad­mission (iv) Class files. “We could not find the above named student. We hope the informa­tion above will be useful.” But in the new letter, the college confirmed that Muri­tala was its student from 1995 to 1998. It however explained that the SDP gubernatorial can­didate did not sit for the West African Examination Council (WAEC) in the institution in 1998, “hence the absence of his name in the 1998 WAEC gazette.” The request for authenti­cation of the governorship candidate’s student status had read, “I hereby write to attach a testimonial issued to Muritala Yakubu by this highly presti­gious institution. POLL “We would be most grateful for your assistance in confirm­ing this information.”
