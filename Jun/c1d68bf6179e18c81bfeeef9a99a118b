Manchester United’s hopes of signing Adrien Rabiot are over after the Frenchman decided to sign a new deal with Juventus. The midfielder came close to joining United last summer when Juventus accepted an £18million bid from the Red Devils. However, United refused to meet his wage demands and deemed them excessive. With Rabiot set to become a free agent on July 1st, United recently made contact with the Frenchman over a move to Old Trafford. After a stellar season in Turin, United were more willing to meet his wage demands as they would no longer be required to pay a fee for Rabiot. However, Corriere dello Sport claim Rabiot has reached an agreement over a £6.2m-a-year contract with Juventus that he will sign on Wednesday. The Frenchman will put pen-to-paper on the new deal on Juventus to end United’s hopes of landing him. United have endured a difficult transfer window so far, with the club submitting three failed bids for Chelsea’s Mason Mount. POLL While Rabiot was not considered an alternative to Mount, Erik ten Hag wants two midfielders this summer. Rabiot would have been a savvy addition given he would have arrived on a free transfer, and United are operating on a tight budget this summer. Ten Hag wants a goalkeeper, a central defender, two midfielders and a forward this summer.
