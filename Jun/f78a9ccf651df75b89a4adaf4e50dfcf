LAGOS  – The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), has stated that it was unlawful for the Federal Government to have withdrawn the Subsidy on PMS, adding that the 2023 Appropriation Act made provisions for the funding of the subsidy regime till the end of June, 2023 The Congress in its Communique at the end of an emergency National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held at the weekend in Abuja, signed by Comrade Joe Ajaero, President of NLC, and Comrade Emmanuel Ugboaja, General Secretary, stated that the Federal Government’s decision was unilateral and therefore, runs counter to the spirit of national consensus and Social Dialogue. The NEC-in-session at the meeting considered the huge suffering pervading the nation, the outrage expressed by the majority and the increased attendant fears of the consequences of the PMS price hike, and therefore, unanimously condemned the actions of the Federal Government Part of the resolutions by the NEC-in-session read: “there is a subsisting judgment of the Court that voided the powers of the Nigerian state to deregulate and fix prices of petroleum products in the Country. “Between 1993 and 2023 about U$6b was used for Turn Around Maintenance of the Refineries without any results “U$7b was given to 14 banks owned by the elite from Public treasury to keep them afloat. “Between 2016 and now, N26tr was given to the rich as import waivers “The NNPC is still unable to tell us how it arrived at the Pricing templates and the names of the beneficiaries of the Subsidy funds.
