ABUJA – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has assured its youth wing that Atiku Abubakar will retrieve his mandate very soon. The party also expressed confidence that the presidential election petition tribunal will do the right thing as Nigerians are waiting to see the outcome of their judgment. The Party National Youth Leader, Prince Muhammed Kadade Suleiman, stated this yesterday, during an interactive session with the women’s wing at the party’s national headquarters, Abuja. Assuring the youths that their labour for the party will not go unrewarded, Suleiman said, “Your contributions to PDP is a sacrifice to Nigerians, you’ve done your best and it is time for us to come together and rebuild this party. “I invited you for this meeting because most of you are being discouraged, but by the grace of God, we will retrieve our mandate. “If today PDP is claiming of winning this election, it is your efforts. Because You are the younger generation. Your efforts during the election will not go in vain. “By the grace of God, we will all reward you, even though we are in court, there is a way to reward somebody who has made a lot of sacrifices for the party, and it is time to reward you, people.” POLL The Deputy National Youth Leader of the party, Elder Tim Osadolo, who also spoke, asked the women who came in large numbers not to be discouraged as hope is not lost. He said: “You women were the pillars before, during and after the election. Your efforts will be adequately rewarded. The women, while speaking with newsmen, were unanimous in their belief that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and Peoples Democratic Party will retrieve their mandate through the election petition tribunal.
