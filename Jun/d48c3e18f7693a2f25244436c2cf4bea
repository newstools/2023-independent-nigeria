BUREAU CHIEF BENIN – Edo State Governor’s wife, Betsy Obaseki has expressed a strong position against domestic abuse, emphasising the need for wom­en to prioritise their safety and well-being. Mrs. Obaseki made her views known during a sympathy and heartfelt visit to a courageous survivor of domestic violence, Mrs. Tina Okhiria whose arm was tragically amputated due to a gunshot allegedly inflicted on her by her abusive husband. During her visit, the First Lady spoke with the victim’s mother, seeking to understand the circumstances leading up to the incident and the actions taken by the family. The mother revealed that she was aware of the ongoing abuse and that her daughter who had left the abusive marriage on sev­eral occasions was swayed by ap­peals from her abusive husband because of her concern for their children. Expressing her concern, the First Lady stressed that no wom­an should endure such cruelty and urged victims to seek help and escape dangerous situa­tions. She emphasised the im­portance of leaving an abusive marriage rather than dying in it. She firmly stated that the abusive husband would face le­gal consequences for his actions, as the crime committed was against the state and could not be resolved through arbitration or appeals. Drawing attention to the resources available through the Ministry of Gender, the First Lady assured the pub­lic that there are avenues to address issues of spousal bat­tery and prevent them from escalating. She also emphasised that no person, regardless of status or influence, has the right to abuse their spouse. Marriage, she said, should be a source of happiness and fulfillment, not a prison sen­tence.
