Dr. Olisa Agbakoba, a renowned human rights lawyer and activist, has faulted the Department of State Service (DSS) on its role in the arrest and detention of Godwin Emefiele, the suspended Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor. The experienced rights activist said as long as there was no issue of security surrounding why the former CBN governor was arrested, the state secret service had no business with the arrest and detention of Emefiele. Taking to his Twitter handle on Sunday, Agbakoba said he had no issue with the suspension of the erstwhile central bank boss, admitting that the suspension did not come to him as surprise but questioned the constitutional framework under which the DSS got involved. He highlighted that the constitutional role of the state secret service remained internal security, saying unless there is an issue of security, the involvement of DSS in the Emefiele issue was unnecessary. Agbakoba twitted: “The suspension of the Governor of CBN @cenbank from office is not a surprise as his tenure was way beyond monetary policy. “But confirmation by DSS @StateDeptDSS that Governor Emefiele is in its custody comes as a shock. The statutory role of DSS is internal security and I shudder to think what role DSS will play in this matter. “The rule of law says it all. Can the relevant agency responsible for Governor Emefiele step forward but this excludes the DSS unless this has security implications,” he said. Emefiele was suspended as the apex bank governor by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and was subsequently arrested and whisked away to Abuja, with Nigerians divided on the necessity or otherwise of the arrest.
