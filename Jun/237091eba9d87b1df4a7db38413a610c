Governor of Plateau State, Caleb Mutfwang has cried out over inherited Eleven billion naria (N11 billion) unpaid workers’ salaries his predecessor Barr. Simon Lalong left behind for his new administration to pay to his state work force. Mutfwang gave this hint in Jos at an event Organized by the state-owned media in conjunction with the office of the Director of Press and Public Affairs to the Governor. According to him, out of a wage bill of N2.9bn for the month of February 2023, only N900 million was paid to the workers by the past administration. Governor Mutfwang said, “Over the years, Plateau state had deviated from the right paths and that is why we decided to steer the state to the right. With the little we have seen since taking over, there is a lot of work to be done. We inherited a civil service on strike. Out of a wage of N2.9bn for February 2023, only N900 million was paid. As of now, I can tell the people of Plateau state without politicking that we are owing salaries up to May to the tune of N11bn and what we inherited in the coffers of the Plateau state Government is N11bn”Mutfwang disclosed. Governor Mutfwang said he did not want to pressurise the workers currently on strike to return to their duty posts because he was sourcing for money to enable him pay them their entitlements before they could resume by the end of this month. He also disclosed that he did not sack the workers recruited into the civil service by his predecessor but only suspended them to pave the way for investigation because of irregularities perpetrated by the past government during their recruitment. “We did not sack the workers but only suspended the recruitment exercise because we discovered that some of them who were employed by the past administration had their employment letters backdated. This is wrong. So, we are investigating the matter to ensure that laid down rules and regulations are followed,” Governor Mutfwang stated.
