Arsenal will not entertain offers for captain Martin Odegaard as they plan contract talks with the Norwegian. Paris Saint-Germain have been credited with an interest in Odegaard, who weighed in with 15 goals and seven assists as Arsenal finished second in the Premier League this season. The Gunners, however, have no plans to part with Odegaard and are instead ready to begin contracts with him. The midfielder has two years left on his current contract and, while there is an option to extend that by a further year to 2026, Arsenal want to secure his long-term future. Odegaard is happy at Arsenal and he enjoys an excellent relationship with manager Mikel Arteta, who made him captain last summer. The 24-year-old is also settled in London, so much so that he is spending the first part of his summer break there before heading back to see his family in Norway. Arsenal are looking to bolster their squad this summer as they want to compete for the title again next season, but a key part of their project is also tying down their core players. Aaron Ramsdale, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel and Gabriel Martinelli have all signed new contracts and the Gunners are in talks with centre-back William Saliba. POLL Saliba has one year left on his current contract at Arsenal and the club want him to agree fresh terms. The Frenchman excelled for the Gunners this season and they struggled in the run-in when he was injured.
