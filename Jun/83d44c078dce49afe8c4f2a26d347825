He explained that the meeting marked the continuation of this administration’s efforts to secure the collaboration of critical players in the oil industry toward ensuring stability, transparency, and fair competition in the sector. Speaking at a recent dialogue with directors of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) and other business leaders, during his presidential campaign in Lagos, had disclosed that ExxonMobil has no business going to Guyana for gas production when it already has sufficient capacity in Nigeria. Tinubu said, instead of having to dig the ground and build a city, in Guyana, “You (ExxonMobil) have some infrastructure to some extent here in Nigeria, why not negotiate with the Nigerian Government, give us some of the full benefit areas, that Nigeria wants. “I would rather have 40 percent and you take 60 percent if, in the long run, they would provide the necessary incentive and the revenue that I need for accelerated growth and recovery. Let’s take it, if you want to make an omelette you have to break the eggs,” Tinubu stated during his campaign.
