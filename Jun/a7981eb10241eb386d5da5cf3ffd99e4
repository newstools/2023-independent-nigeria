The Nigerian Mission in Libya has facilitated the release of for­ty Nigerian irregular migrants from the Bir Al-Ghanam deten­tion facility in Libya. Amb. Kabiru Musa, Charge D’Affaires En Titre of the Nige­rian Mission in Libya, disclosed this in a statement on Wednes­day in Abuja. According to Musa, the re­leased Nigerian nationals will continue to be catered for by the Mission until they are repatri­ated. Musa said that he admon­ished them on the need to return home, never to embark on such perilous journey again, and also warn their compatriots back home on the dangers of irregu­lar migration. “On Tuesday, June 27, 2023, the mission in its continuous consular assistance to Nigeri­ans in Libya secured the release of forty irregular migrants who were arrested for immigration offences and detained by Libyan immigration authorities for al­most two months. “Among the arrested Nige­rians are 34 females and six males who were detained at Bir Al-Ghanam detention facility that is about 150 miles away from Tripoli, the capital city. “It was discovered that most of them were lured into travel­ling to Libya for greener pasture by their would-be traffickers but they ended up under exploitation and enforced labour. “On arrival at the embassy, we received them, and admonished them on the need to return home with a promise never to embark on such deadly journey through the desert again. POLL “I also encouraged them to feel at home and be willing to give information about their traffick­ers and agents in Nigeria as well as in Libya so that they can be arrested and punished for their crime against humanity. “In the meantime, the mis­sion will continue to cater for their needs including feeding, accommodation, clothing and medicals until they can be re­patriated home through the International Organisation for Migration (IOM),” Musa said.
