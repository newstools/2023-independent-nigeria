During the event, Group Corporate Communications and Events Manager, Dufil Prima Foods Plc, Temitope Ashiwaju expressed Indomie’s commitment to supporting the sickle cell community. According to him, “Indomie is here to hold hands and show support for everyone living with sickle cell anaemia, a genetic disorder that affects people from birth. While we are here to support the Sickle Cell Foundation Nigeria, Indomie is using this opportunity to share some love with the entire Sickle Cell Community, and we are saying loudly, everyone with sickle cell is a hero.” Sickle cell disease is a genetic blood disorder characterized by abnormal haemoglobin, the protein responsible for carrying oxygen in the red cells. It significantly affects the shape and function of red blood cells, leading to various health complications. Chairperson, Coalition of Sickle Cell NGOs, Toyin Adesola noted that “Sickle cell disease poses a significant public health concern in Nigeria. The country bears one of the highest burdens of sickle cell disease worldwide, with a substantial portion of the population carrying the sickle cell trait. Each year, it is estimated that over 150,000 children are born with sickle cell disease in Nigeria representing the highest number of newborns affected by the condition in any country.”
