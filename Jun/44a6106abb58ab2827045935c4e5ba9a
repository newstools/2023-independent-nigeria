JOS – Plateau House of Assembly Lawmakers on Thursday Pass a Vote of No Confidence in the state Commissioner of Police CP Bartholomew Onyeka over the Sealing of the existing 17 LGA Secretariats in Plateau State. They Called for the Immediate re-opening of the 17 Local Government Secretariats. Members of the Plateau 10th Assembly while addressing Newsmen at the Assembly complex through its spokesman Hon Ishaku Maren on Thursday accused the State Commissioner of Police of allegedly Misleading the IGP on the true situation in the state because of his Political Interest and involvement. The Law Makers spokesman Maintained that the Police is supposed to Protect the lives and Properties of citizens and to give proper protection of constituted authorities within the state, but what they enjoyed in the state is a reversal, in which the Police instead of being neutral, they have proven otherwise. He wondered why this same Commissioner of Police refused to enforce orders in the state when immediate speaker Ayuba Abok was reinstated by the court and as well as former Chairman of Langtang North LGA Joshua Laven that was denied reinstatement after winning his case at Jos high court and court of appeal. He added that the suspended local government Chairmen remain suspended over their failure to make available their local governments’ Income and Expenditure reports to the state assembly .
