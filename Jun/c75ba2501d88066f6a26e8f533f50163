UEFA began disciplinary proceedings on Friday against AS Roma coach Jose Mourinho for using insulting and abusive language against an official in the Europa League final. Mourinho, 60, was shown the yellow card by English referee Anthony Taylor during the bad-tempered final in Budapest on Wednesday, which Sevilla won on penalties after a 1-1 draw. He criticised Taylor in his post-match news conference and was later filmed in the stadium car park calling him a “disgrace” in a profanity-laced tirade. Both clubs also face charges over the conduct of their supporters and players. They have both been charged with throwing objects, lighting fireworks and improper conduct of their team. Sevilla have an additional charge for invasion of the field of play, while Roma have also been charged with acts of damage and crowd disturbances.
