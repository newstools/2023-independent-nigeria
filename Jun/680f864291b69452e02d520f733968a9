Bayelsa State Governor Douye Diri has congratulated the re-elected Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Abraham Ingobere, following the inauguration of the 7th State Legislature. Diri had on Tuesday proclaimed the inauguration of the assembly through a letter read on the floor by the Clerk of the House, Kent Adogu. The governor in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Daniel Alabrah, on Wednesday, described Ingobere as “a stabiliser of the polity” and a legislator passionately committed to the enhancement of democracy and to the development of Bayelsa State. He said Ingobere’s re-election to lead the assembly was an acknowledgment of his excellent performance and an affirmation of the confidence reposed in him by his colleagues. According to him, under Ingobere’s leadership of the Sixth Assembly, the state legislature contributed to and greatly enhanced the prevailing peace in the state. He said the assembly also passed key legislations that extended the frontiers of the development of Bayelsa. Diri noted that Ingobere’s role in the assembly ensured the sustenance of democracy by fostering a rancour-free and collaborative relationship with other arms of government, particularly the executive. While congratulating other elected principal officers of the assembly, he urged the new and returning legislators to always place Bayelsa as their priority agenda. POLL Ingobere representing Brass Constituency III was unanimously re-elected by the legislators following a motion moved by the leader, Monday Obolo Bubou. Other principal officers elected were Michael Ogbere, who was also returned unopposed as Deputy Speaker, as well as Bubou, returned as Leader of the House. Bernard Kenebai emerged as Deputy Leader, Gabriel Ogbara, Chief Whip and Ted Elemeforo, Deputy Whip.
