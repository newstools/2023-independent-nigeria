ABUJA – Owing to the crisis thrown up by subsidy removal, the Nige­ria Labour Congess (NLC) has begun mobilisation for a nationwide strike, to take effect from Wednesday next week. The Labour movement is hinging it on the new pump price template for fuel released by the federal government. Recall that President Bola Tinubu had taken to his inau­gural speech at Eagle Square on Monday to declare that “fuel subsidy is gone”. NLC President Joe Ajaero declared the strike after an emergency meeting of the union’s National Executive Council (NEC) in Abuja. He said the government, par­ticularly the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited had up until Wednes­day next week to revert to the old price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) otherwise referred to as petrol. Ajaero added that failure of the Federal Government to meet the ultimatum would at­tract an indefinite protest across the country. Tinubu had also noted that the era of subsidy payment on fuel has ended, adding that with the 2023 budget making no pro­vision for fuel subsidy, further payment was no longer feasible. “The fuel subsidy is gone,” Tinubu said His government would instead channel funds into infrastructure and other areas to strengthen the econo­my, he added. POLL The presidential pronounce­ment led to an almost instant re­surgence of fuel queues across the country with Nigerians criticizing the decision. Tinubu’s decision received backing from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) and House of Representatives, it has since been resisted by the NLC and Trade Union Congress of Ni­geria (TUC). The organised Labour is also threatening to probe the payments made by the Buhari administration in the last eight years
