…Northern Strikers, JTF, Zuph FC Also Slump …Shegbelegbe FC, Polaku, Ohaneze, Biseni United, Otuasega, Apret FC others Progress To Round of 32 Eternal Grace Ministry, EGM FC, who are the defending champions of Nigeria’s largest grassroot football competition, the Bayelsa State Governor’s Football Tournament, have been dumped out of the tournament after suffering a stunning 6-5 defeat through penalties by less fancied side, Rose of Sharon FC. The defending champions EGM FC mounted so much pressure on their opponent from the first half all through the entire encounter, but were unable to find the back of the net, as the game ended in a goalless draw in regulation time at the Opolo centre, were they crashed out on penalties. EGM FC became more nervous and increased their pressure after the break and kept pushing forward, but despite dominating the second half, they were curtailed by the vigilant Rose of Sharon FC defenders. The tournament’s fourth holder of the title, unfortunately, failed to defend the trophy despite trouncing ‘School Boys’ Faith Comprehensive Secondary School 15-0 in their opening fixture. Rose of Sharon FC’s victory could be likened to Okodi FC upset against last year’s semi-finalist Anyama FC of Ogbia who lost one nil to neighbours Okodi FC at the Otuopoti venue. Elsewhere in the competition at the Ogboloma centre, Polaku FC beat God’s Grace Stars FC 3-2 just as Biseni United defeated  Okolobiri FC 3-0 in same centre. POLL Ohaneze FC also progressed to the next phase with a 2-1 victory over Zola FC, NMA FC at the Okordia centre kept their hopes of moving to the money spinning stage as they beat another faith based organization City Zuph FC 4-3 on penalties after an entertaining two all draw. Igbogene FC at the Ogboloma centre humbled JTF H/QTRS 3-0, Ogbolo FC at the Kpansia centre eased out Agbura FC 2-1, Dream Academy at the Tombia centre pipped Northern Strikers 3-1 to end Northern Strikers fairytale run in the competition, while Kpansia 3 FC in the second game beat Experience Academy by a lone goal. Action returns tomorrow in matchday thirteen of Nigeria’s biggest grassroots football tournament across different centres.
