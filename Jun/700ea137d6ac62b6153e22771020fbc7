LAGOS – Chief Bode George, former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described as a sheer fallacy and a bundle of untruth the rumour renting the air that he has accepted a political job under President Bola Tinubu-led APC’s administration. According to a press statement on Friday, the statesman said that he’s too old to engage in any full-time work, let alone apply for one from another political party. He said, “Whoever is behind such a story that I have accepted a job from the Federal Government is being clever by half and economical with the truth. “At nearly eight decades on mother earth, I should be allowed to enjoy my role as a patriot and advisor on good governance. Nobody should bandy my name to earn cheap popularity in the media,” the Lagos-born retired Naval Officer emphasized. “My prayer is for the greater benefit for the greater majority of Nigerians. I hate to see my fellow countrymen and women suffer. Welfare and security of the citizenry should be the top priority of any government.” On the fence-mending effort by a Lagos group to cement the relationship between him and Tinubu, he stated thus: “I appreciate the brains behind the ongoing parley. But for the records, there’s nothing personal between him and me. Our differences are basically hinged on principles, which we are both entitled to. I wish him and all Nigerians well. “Meanwhile, I am not available for any job, and those pushing for one for me, should count old me out of their desire,” Bode George said.
