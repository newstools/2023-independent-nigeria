The Anambra State Internal Revenue Service (AIRS) conducted a personnel audit last weekend to check what it termed ghost workers earning free salaries without physical presence in the organisation. The staff audit which was conducted at the Revenue House Awka became pertinent with the exit of the former AIRS boss, Mr. Richard Madiebo, to ascertain the real and authentic workforce of the state revenue agency to avoid wastage of government’s lean resources. The acting chairman of the Anambra State Internal Revenue Service, Dr. Greg Ezeilo, told our correspondent who was at the head count of the revenue agency that henceforth Anambra State would have a world-class revenue agency because the aim of the personnel audit was to get everyone involved to achieve a new AIRS. Ezeilo explained that what the agency did was housekeeping, beginning with head count because the board has to know those working with it. He said there were instances of people who didn’t know who they were or where they work but that at the end of the month, because the agency does electronic payments, money goes into their accounts and they smile, not bothering about how their money came about. He also disclosed that as a skillful manager, he needed to find out the gaps and close them. He said the executives of the revenue service were just three at the moment and that they wanted to ensure that round pegs were in round holes and square pegs in square holes. He said it was the very first of what they wanted to do in order to start on a very clean slate, adding that the personnel audit was very symbolic and important too because it was pertinent that they identified those in the employ of the Anambra State Internal Revenue Service.
