Nine drones were downed on Sunday in Crimea, said the Russian-appointed head of the region, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. “Over the past night, air defense forces shot down 5 enemy UAVs (uncrewed aerial vehicles), 4 more were jammed and planted by electronic warfare,” Sergey Aksyonov said in a statement on Telegram. Aksyonov said that the fall of one of the drones damaged three private homes and two cars in the city of Dzhankoi. An unexploded drone was also found on the territory of a private household, he added. “As a result of the night attack, there were no victims or injured,” Aksyonov said. Ukrainian officials have not yet commented on the incident. In 2014, Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, a move widely viewed as illegal by the international community, including Türkiye and the UN General Assembly.
