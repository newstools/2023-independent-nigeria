LAGOS – The Association of Local Gov­ernments of Nigeria (ALGON) has signed a partnership deal with the National Image Ed­ucational Consult to enhance youth empowerment and push the promotion of the educa­tional agenda of the President Bola Tinubu-led Federal Gov­ernment. Speaking shortly after sign­ing the agreement, National President of ALGON, Alabi Ko­lade David, lauded the National Image Educational Consult for the initiative, adding that pro­motion of youth empowerment and education agenda will en­gender rapid growth and devel­opment of the country. David emphasized that em­powerment of Nigerian youths is an agenda that will promote nation-building and reduce in­security across the nation. Alabi, while harping on what the partnership entails, said that ALGON offices in the 774 local government areas of the country will embark on the campaign to identify qualified youths who have been hindered from furthering their education on the account of financial chal­lenges. He said they will be enrolled in a scholarship scheme of the National Image Educational Consult, which is in line with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s Agenda of ensuring accessible education for the youths of the country. In his remarks, the Manag­ing Director, Chief Executive Officer of National Image Ed­ucational Consult, Seyi Bam­igbade, said the organisation has in the past five years driven tuition-free education across the country. Bamigbade said that efforts are ongoing to increase the number of enrollment through the educational policy of the Federal Government, which seeks to ensure that the majori­ty of Nigerian youths are given access to education.
