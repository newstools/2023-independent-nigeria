For the second time Olumuyiwa Adejobi, the spokesperson for the Nigeria Police, has called for the arrest and possible prosecution of Ibadan-based prankster who goes by the name, Trinity Guy. Reacting to a video of Trinity Guy, which many have described as child-sexual abuse, Adejobi who had earlier called for his arrest reiterated his stand on Twitter “This is rubbish and criminal. This guy should be arrested and charged to court. We will act as soon as possible. I hate this scene. Child abuse,” he wrote via his Twitter handle. The Force PRO had previously warned skit makers who rely on pranks for their content, urging them to regulate their actions as they threaten Nigerians’ lives. On Monday, he posted a video on Instagram calling for his arrest. “This doesn’t make any sense, and I think the guy should have been arrested. Those individuals who feel the heat and fear of the pranks should report the pranksters as many of their pranks are criminal, immoral, and evil. These women have a good case against him,” he wrote. He then urged people affected by the skitmaker’s’ pranks to report him to the authorities while urging victims of such pranks to take legal action against the skit makers involved. He added; “We have warned them severally. When nothing happens, nothing happens, but when something happens, consequences will surely follow. They will soon realise the dangers attributed to the excessiveness of doing unguided pranks.” The Ibadan-based prankster, who started his career in 2018 by removing the wigs of random women on the streets, currently shares prank videos that feature him pretending to be killed by a gunshot. POLL Trinity Guy, who is a failed hip-hop artiste, in a recent Punch newspaper interview, claimed that a prank video landed a man in the hospital.
