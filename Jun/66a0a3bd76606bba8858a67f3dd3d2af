GOMBE  – The Gombe State House of Assembly has approved the extension of tenure and reap­pointment of the eleven Local Government Caretaker Chair­men from June to December 2023. This is in response to a letter sent to the House by the State Governor, Muhammadu Inu­wa Yahaya, read on the floor of the House by the Clerk, Bar­rister Rukkaiyatu Adamu Jalo during a special sitting. Moving a motion to that effect, Adamu Saleh Pata, a member representing the Ya­maltu East constituency, said there is a need for continuity in any governance, and there­fore called on his colleagues to give speedy legislative ap­proval. He, however, emphasised the need for synergy between the caretaker chairmen and the legislators as both are moving in the same direction for the good governance of the people.
