LAGOS – As the camp of Nigeria’s Super Eagles continues to bubble ahead of this weekend’s showdown against the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone in Monrovia, the General Secretary of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Dr Sanusi Mohammed has tasked players of the Super Eagles to go all out for a win against their opponent on Sunday in Liberia. While speaking at the weekend in Abuja, Dr. Sanusi, said victory for the Super Eagles will be vital for Nigeria to seal her qualification to next year’s AFCON championship in Cote D’Ivoire. He urged the team not to undermine the strength of her opponent, seeing that what Nigerians expect from them is an irresistible impulse and the desire to secure a Nations Cup slot with an outright victory against her opponent on Sunday. He went on to further say that the players are privy to the task they have at hand, and assured that the pain of missing out of the world cup will serve as a motivating factor, which will spur them to do the needful when they face their Sierra Leonian counterpart this weekend. He said: “I can assure you we’re going to Liberia by the grace of God to win and we hope that you’ll continue to give us that support. “The task you will put before them is to go and win for Nigeria. As a Nigerian, that is what I expect from them, every Nigerian expect victory from them, the victory will seal our qualification. “For the players, they already know what is ahead of them, the pain of not going to the World Cup is still disturbing them, and it is disturbing every Nigerian and they are leaving no stone unturned to make sure they qualify for all competitions we registered for,” he said. Nigeria currently sits top of group A of the AFCON table with nine points, and will qualify for Cote D’Ivoire 2023 with a win against Sierra Leone in Matchday 5 of the qualifiers billed for July 18 in Monrovia, Liberia.
