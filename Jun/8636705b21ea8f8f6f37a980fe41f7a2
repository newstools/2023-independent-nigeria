ABUJA – All Progressives Congress (APC) Chieftain, Sani Shinkafi has condemned what he described as the invasion of the residences of former Zamfara State governor, Bello Matawalle in Gusau and Maradun. Shinkafi in a statement on Saturday stressed that the move was “outrageous, despicable, barbaric and impunity taken too far by the Police…” The statement also lambasted the police action as “inconceivable”, adding that invasion of the homes of the immediate past governor of the state “is coming few days after he handed over power peacefully to Governor Dauda Lawal of the Peoples Democratic Party.” While maintaining that “Nigeria is governed by a rule of law, not might,” the member of Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign Council called on the Inspector General of Police to order his personnel to vacate the occupied premises immediately, as he maintained that the police should invite the ex governor of it thinks that he has a case to answer. “Nigeria is not a banana republic. All lovers of democracy should condemn this dastardly action of the nation’s law enforcement agents who took laws into their hands to invade Matallewe’s homes in Gusau and Maradun in Zamfara State and condoned off roads leading to the houses in flagrant violation of his fundamental human rights as enshrined in the 1999 constitution as amended. It is unfair, unjust and unacceptable. “I strongly condemn this politically motivated action of the Police to embarrass, harass and intimidate the former governor of the state. This show of shame must stop to save our hard earned democracy,” he explained.
