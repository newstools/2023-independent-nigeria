A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State, Amb. Abayomi Nurain Mumuni has con­gratulated the Muslim ummah on the occasion of Eid-al-Adha. Mumuni, in a statement by his media aide Rasheed Abubakar, on Wednesday, June 28, said the faithful should give glory to Almighty Allah for the opportunity to witness anoth­er Eid. The Eid-al-Adha is the feast of sac­rifice which usually coincides with Hajj, a major pillar of Islam. “Let me also felicitate our broth­ers and sisters who are far away in Saudi Arabia for hajj rites. May Al­lah accept the rites from them as an act of worship. May He forgive them all their sins, grant their prayer re­quests and turn them into newborns as promised,” he said. “I wish all of the pilgrims a safe return to their places of origin.” Mumuni meanwhile charged Ni­gerians to rally support for President Bola Ahmed Tinubu whom he said is very passionate about the growth and development of the country.
