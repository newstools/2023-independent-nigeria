ABUJA – As the 10th National Assembly members-elect settles down to the business of legislation, a human rights activist, Comrade Igbini Emmanuel has stressed the need for a vibrant minority leader that will draw the attention of legislators to the policies of the government. Comrade Igbini gave his opinion in reaction to the emergence of Senator Godswill Akpabio as Senate President, recently. He urged the House of Representatives to nominate Hon. Chinda Kingsley, the Federal Representative, representing Obio/Akpor constituency. He said the National Assembly needs a fair minority leader who is patriotic and courageous to ensure proper checks against the government. “I am concerned about who emerges as the minority and deputy minority leader of the Senate as well as that of the House of Representatives. “I do not know those who are aspiring in the Senate but without fear of favour, I also do know one of those aspiring to be the minority leader in the House of Representatives in the 10th National Assembly. “I am talking about Hon. Kingsley Chinda. This gentleman was the chairman of the public account committee in the 8th House of Representatives. “While he was there it was clear to everybody that he carried out serious checks and investigations that led to the introduction of technology into the way Audit processes are carried out. A person with such transparency will lead the minority to our desire of a renewed Nigeria,” he stated on Friday.
