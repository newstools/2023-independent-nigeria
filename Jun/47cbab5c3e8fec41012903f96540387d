A Jos High Court Sitting in Langtang North LGA has dismissed the suit filed by the Impostor Chairman of Langtang North local government area Bitrus Zulfa involving Zenith Bank plc for freezing of the council accounts in August 2022. According to the Impostor Chairman, the action of the Bank denied him access to the accounts to enable him to pay staff salaries and other related matters in the council. Justice J D Longden while delivering judgement in the matter dismissed the case on the ground that the embattled chairman had no right to claim the authentic signatory to the account when he was not the elected council chairman and as such cannot be granted access to the council account According to the Judge, zenith bank plc where the council funds are kept cannot in the first place deal with Bitrus Zulfa because he was never the elected council chairman The authentic chairman of Langtang North local government area in the judgement granted access to the accounts of the local government area having been recognised as the authentic chairman of the council It would be recalled that Council Chairman Joshua Laven Ubandoma had before now filed an action in Court against Zenith Bank in August 2022 challenging the restriction of the Langtang North account in its custody. The court in upholding the objection of the 2nd defendant(Joshua Laven Ubandoma) and in dismissing the suit held that the 1st defendant(zenith bank)was right in restricting the account as it is only Joshua Laven Ubandoma that has access to the said account. The authentic Chairman of the Local Government Area Joshua Laven Ubandoma in his reaction to the judgement, told newsmen that once again, the court which is the last hope of the common man has again proved that he remains the authentic chairman of Langtang North local government area having been elected the council chairman but was not sworn in by the former All Progressives Congress-led administration of Simon Lalong. POLL According to Laven, after a genuine court judgement in his favour, he was sworn in a year later. He disclosed that two years into his tenure, the Plateau state independent Electoral Commission went ahead to conduct fresh local government elections in his LGA despite the court judgement that there was no vacancy in the council, but went ahead to conduct this election produced the embattled Bitrus Zulfa as chairman. â€œAgain l went to court and get a judgement that the then APC-led administration refused to honour and l believe that with this judgement, it has put to rest the lingering crisis that has rocked and denied Langtang North LGA democratic dividends.
