ABUJA – The Department of State Services (DSS) which hitherto denied arresting the suspended Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele has suddenly confirmed that the embattled CBN Boss “is now in its custody for some investigative reasons.” The Services in a fresh statement signed by its Spokesperson, Dr. Peter Afunanya also enjoined the public, particularly the Media to “apply utmost caution in the reportage and narratives concerning this.” This is coming on the heels of widespread rumours on social media about the alleged arrest of the suspended CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele on Friday evening by the DSS. However, the DSS Spokesperson, Dr. Afunanya in a terse statement to newsmen earlier on Saturday said, “Currently, Emefiele is not with the DSS.” The embattled CBN Governor who was suspended by President Tinubu has been having running battles with the new administration following his perceived failed naira redesign policy. News making the rounds is that the CBN governor was arrested by the DSS shortly after he was suspended from office. In a statement announcing the suspension of Emefiele, President Tinubu through the office of the Secretary Government of the Federation (SGF), said the “suspension is as a result of the ongoing investigation of his office and the planned reforms in the financial sector of the economy.” Willie Bassey, Director, Information for Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Sen. George Akume observed that “Mr Emefiele has been directed to immediately hand over the affairs of his office to the Deputy Governor (Operations Directorate), who will act as the Central Bank Governor pending the conclusion of the investigation and the reforms.
