ENUGU – Sequel to the declaration by governor of Enugu State, Barr. Peter Ndubuisi Mbah, putting an end to the sit-at-home in the state, the Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Ammani, has ordered Area Commanders, Di­visional Police Officers, Com­manders of PMF Squadron Bas­es, other tactical and operational units of the command, to deploy personnel and all the operation­al and intelligence resources at their disposal to actualise the declaration, by ensuring maxi­mum public security and safety of citizens and property in the state on the hitherto illegal Sit-at-home days. In a statement made avail­able to Journalists in Enugu on saturday, DSP Daniel Ndukwe, state Police Public Relations Officer,further directs them to ensure that the strategies already devised to reverse the ugly trend are implemented to the letter, warning that lapses on their parts shall not be tolerated. The Commissioner noted that innocent and law-abiding citizens of the State deserve to go about their lawful businesses without fear of harassment or physical threats by unscrupu­lous and subversive criminal elements, enforcing the illegal Sit-at-home order. He tasked the Supervisory Officers and personnel under them to live up to expectations, by ensuring that every part of the State is visibly patrolled and necessary policing actions tak­en to forestall possible adverse activities of the undesirable criminal elements. CP Ammani reiterates that the operations to end the illegal Sit-at-home order will be jointly executed by the Police, the Mil­itary, and other Security Agen­cies in the State. He therefore warned unre­pentant and subversive crimi­nal elements, known to have in recent times murdered fellow brothers and sisters, destroyed their property and disrupted the social and economic well-being of their people without con­science, in the name of enforc­ing the inconceivable illegal Sit-at-home order, to turn over a new leaf, as the Security Forces shall not spare any person or in­dividuals found wanting.
