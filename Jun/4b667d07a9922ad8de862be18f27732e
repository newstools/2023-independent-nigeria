Multiple reports in Italy claim Massimiliano Allegri argued with club director Francesco Calvo after seeing Paulo Dybala convert a ‘debatable’ penalty in Roma–Spezia, sending Juventus to the Conference League. La Gazzetta dello Sport and Tuttosport claim Allegri and Calvo are not on good terms and tension between the pair erupted on Sunday night following Juventus’ 1-0 win in Udine. It wasn’t enough to earn a Europa League placement as Roma secured a 2-1 victory against Spezia. Dybala, a former Juventus striker, helped the Giallorossi win by converting a late penalty kick at the Stadio Olimpico. Allegri thought the penalty call was soft and blamed Calvo for being unable to protect Juventus off the pitch this season. As highlighted by Football Italia on Monday, Allegri sent clear messages to the club director from the Dacia Arena, leaving doubts over his stay at the club. The Livorno-born coach also appeared to taunt Calvo by saying he was grateful to all those working “inside” the Continassa. The coach has gone on holiday and won’t meet the club directors soon. According to Gazzetta, a preliminary meeting to discuss the plans for next season already took place last week.
