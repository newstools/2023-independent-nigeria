LAGOS – Venerable (now Bishop-elect) Ifedola Okupevi was born on January 17, 1963, So, the Anglican Priest clocked the Diamond age of 60 and was welcomed into the Sexagenerian Club on January 17, 2023.

Not satisfied with that, the aggressive pursuer of knowledge went ahead to enroll for and in record time, pocket a Master’s degree in Christian Religious Studies from the same varsity.   and even as of the time of putting this profile together, the Venerable-turned Bishop is on the verge of taking his doctoral scroll from the same LASU which is today rated the Best State University in Nigeria.
