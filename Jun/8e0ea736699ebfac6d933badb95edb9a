Comedian and actor, Adebowale Adedayo, aka Mr Macaroni, has revealed how he soaked in depression after he was expelled from the University. The skit-maker made the revelation while chronicling his journey towards becoming a graduate in a tweet on Saturday. He added that he attended four universities and got expelled while studying at one of the universities. Following the expulsion, Mr Macaroni, however, noted that he was recalled and later graduated, adding that he was battling depression during his studies. He also recounted how he surmounted the challenges he encountered while trying to make a name for himself in the entertainment industry. His tweet in broken English read, “I was dealing with depression in late 2017/2018. That was the period I was expelled from Uni. And it was the 4th University at the time. Abeg wetin consine me with watching a film then? My life sef na film wey people dey watch. “From 2018-2019 was another round of depression. I continued hustling for roles again in Nollywood.
