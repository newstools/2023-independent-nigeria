The Russian Federation has upped the ante in the Black Sea region by increasing its number of missile carriers to four, according to Operational Command South’s Facebook announcement. The latest addition, the frigate Admiral Essen, is now on active combat duty. Ukrinform, the Ukrainian National News Agency, has been tracking this developing situation closely. The agency reports that there are now two surface and two underwater missile carriers in the sea. These vessels carry a collective salvo of up to 24 Kalibr missiles. This latest move by Russia, escalating its military presence, has significantly increased the threat of missile strikes in the region. The Operational Command South has highlighted this threat as “extremely high” in their public communication. Just a few days ago, as of the morning of June 1, three missile carriers were reported to be on combat duty in the Black Sea, with a combined total of up to 16 Kalibr missiles. The additional missile carrier escalates the potential firepower in the region by 50%. This increased presence in the Black Sea is another chapter in the ongoing tension between Russia and the NATO member countries. It represents a strategic move, as the Black Sea is an area of significant geopolitical interest for both NATO and Russia. The international community and security analysts around the globe are keeping a close eye on this developing situation. The increased missile carrier presence could destabilize the already tense relations in the region and has potential implications for the security balance across Eastern Europe. The Admiral Essen is a frigate belonging to the Russian Navy, named after Nikolai Ottovich von Essen, a Russian naval commander of Baltic German descent. This vessel is part of the Admiral Grigorovich class of frigates, which are among the most advanced surface vessels in Russia’s naval fleet as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. The Admiral Essen was commissioned in June 2016. It is designed for multi-purpose roles, being capable of anti-ship, anti-submarine, and anti-aircraft warfare. The vessel carries an array of weaponry, including the Russian-made Kalibr land-attack cruise missiles, which have been used extensively in conflicts like the Syrian Civil War. POLL In terms of specifics, the Admiral Essen displaces about 4,000 tons, measures approximately 124.8 meters in length, and can reach speeds of up to 30 knots. Its crew consists of around 200 personnel. Its arsenal includes the A-190 100mm naval gun, anti-ship and anti-submarine torpedoes, and anti-aircraft missiles. It also has a helicopter pad and hangar, allowing it to support anti-submarine warfare and search-and-rescue operations.
