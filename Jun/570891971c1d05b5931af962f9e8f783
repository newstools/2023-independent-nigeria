Human Rights Writers Asso­ciation of Nigeria (HURIWA) has supported Anambra State Governor Charles Soludo’s call forIgbo indigenes across Nigeria and all over the world to investin the five South-East states to de­velop the economy of theregion. The civil rights advocacy group, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Em­manuel Onwubiko, noted that it backed the call by the Anambra State governor who recently urged indigenes of the state, who are based in La­gos State, that their homeland is ready for business, stress­ing that investing in the state would be in their best interest. The group said it is import­ant that Ndigbo in the Diaspo­ra and across the country do everything possible to repatri­ate some of their businesses and contribute to economic development of the region. HURIWA also tasked other South-East governors to take a cue from Soludo in conscien­tising their indigenes in oth­er states to remember their homeland and contribute to its economy. It said: “The call by Soludo is laudable. It is important that South-East governors jointly visit Lagos to consci­entise Igbo to, at least, return 45 per cent of their investable, profitable, job and wealth cre­ating businesses to the region.
