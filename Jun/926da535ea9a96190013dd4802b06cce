The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has stated that any tertiary institution still processing admissions outside the Central Admissions Processing System (CAPS) is doing so at its own risk, stressing that any admission not processed on CAPS is illegal. The Jigawa State Coordinator, Mr. Bello Aminu, disclosed this in his office in Dutse on Monday, when he played host to the Registrar, Jigawa State College of Advanced and Remedial Studies (JICORAS), Dr. Rabiu Saleh Kazaure. Earlier in his address, Dr. Kazaure said he had visited the office to seek clarifications on some grey areas on the admission procedures into tertiary institutions in the country. In his remarks, the State Coordinator welcomed the Registrar and urged him to ensure that his institution adheres strictly to all extant policy guidelines on admissions, adding that JAMB had prohibited will not condone illegitimate admissions since 2021. The Registrar, while pledging the readiness of his school to comply with all admission guidelines, commended the board for its efforts at ensuring fairness in the admission value chain across tertiary institutions in Nigeria.
