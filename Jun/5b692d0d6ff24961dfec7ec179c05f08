Operatives of the Nation­al Drug Law Enforce­ment Agency (NDLEA) have stormed Iwe forest in Iwe community, Owan West Local Government Area of Edo State, where they located a large warehouse of skunk, used to store 231 jumbo bags of the psy­chotropic substance weighing 3,003 kilograms (over 3 tons), which was set ablaze. According to Femi Babafemi, NDLEA Director, Media and Ad­vocacy, the operation involving hundreds of well-armed agency operatives in the early hours of Tuesday followed intelligence that a wanted drug kingpin had stored tons of the illicit sub­stance in the forest ready for distribution to other parts of the country.

He said the request for 100 percent examination of the shipment followed earlier intelligence received by the agency on the container.
