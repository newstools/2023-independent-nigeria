BENIN – Prince Clem Ikanade Agba, the immediate past Minister of State for Budget and Na­tional Planning, has distanced himself from some articles purportedly written by some individuals as responses to Oba of Benin’s inquiries about his stewardship as a minister. He said those writing such articles that were trending online were not known to him (Agba), nor did he sponsor any article or commission anyone to reply to the Oba whom he described as his father. Ewuare II had, during Ag­ba’s visit to the Benin throne on June 15, questioned the former minister about his stewardship in the state. Agba, in a statement signed and made available to news­men in Benin, Thursday eve­ning entitled: “Disclaimer No­tice”, said: “I do not, I repeat, I do not, and I will not have any disagreements with His Royal Majesty, Oba of Benin King­dom, on any matter whatso­ever.” Agba’s statement read in part, “I would like to address some commentaries and arti­cles that have come to my atten­tion, purportedly in response to the questions I received from our esteemed Royal Father, His Royal Majesty, Omo N’oba N’edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Oba Ewuare ll, Oba of Benin King­dom about my stewardship.” “Let me make it clear, without any doubt, that the commentaries and articles that have surfaced are neither sought nor sponsored by me. It is not my nature to join issues in public with our royal father. He is not only my father but also the father of all of us in Edo State.”
