BIRNIN-KEBBI – Kebbi State Governor Nasir Idris Gwandu has appealed to Nigerians to positively change their attitude to take the country to next level of development. He made this known in a message on the 30th anniversary of the annulment of June 12 presidential election. It could be recalled that the Federal Government had in 2021 declared June 12 as Democracy Day to replace May 29. Gov. Idris stressed the need for Nigerians to change their attitude towards what would bring positive development not only to the generality of people but also to the nation. He lamented that as an African society, Nigeria possessed good and excellent values, norms and traditions that would propel and project the image of the country and the continent at large but wondered why, “we imbibe some alien cultures of insincerity, corruption, deception, theft and mistrust.” The governor observed that: “To achieve Nigeria of our dreams, we as citizens must first change our values, attitudes and orientation. We must see Nigeria as our fatherland and we don’t have any other country except Nigeria. “Remember, values are the building blocks of national development and no nation can achieve its developmental aspirations unless her citizens embrace and espouse the right values and attitudes,” he said. Idris blamed Nigeria’s socio-economic problems on lack of value orientation. POLL “Like other nations of the world, Nigeria has always had its own set of values which are expected to shape behaviors and drive the process of development. “These values, also known as national ethics are enshrined in chapter two, Section 23 of the 1999 constitution (as amended). They include discipline, integrity, dignity of labour, social justice, religious tolerance, self reliance and patriotism,” he noted. While congratulating Nigerians on occasion of democracy day he assured people of Kebbi state of his resolve to give them dividends of democracy.
