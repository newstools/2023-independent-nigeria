The Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodimma, has commended workers in the state for not yielding to “self-orchestrated and imported” strikes in the state, emphasising that the best approach to government / labour relations remains through dialogue. Uzodimma spoke on Tuesday at a workshop on the theme: “Dialogue: Best Option in Resolving Industrial Disputes” organised by the Office of the Special Adviser to the Governor on Labour Matters, held in Road, Owerri. The Governor, who was represented by the Commissioner for Education, Prof. Johncliff Nwadike, said as a labour friendly governor, he always recognises the need for cordial government/labour relationship, the reason he did approved the workshop as well as the appointment of the former NLC Chairman in the state as Special Adviser on Labour Matters. He said that the theme of the workshop was apt as “it is meant to cement what is already on ground in Imo State, that is, harmonious relationship between labour and government.” The Governor said that the state is able to end industrial actions because the state’s workforce has been getting what is due to them. He listed prompt payment of salaries, promotions for workers, advertisements for employment, conducive State Secretariat, provision of staff free bus to and from office, ensuring that no genuine and legitimate worker is abandoned or allowed to shed tears, among others. The Governor, however, expressed his gratitude to Imo workers for recently resisting what was “obviously an orchestrated and imported strike foisted on them by a proud few”. Uzodimma counselled that for all issues between government and labour, the best approach at all levels and times is dialogue.
