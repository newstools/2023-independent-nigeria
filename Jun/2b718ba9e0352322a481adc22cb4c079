The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has lauded the sack of Mr. Godwin Emefiele, the ex-governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) by President Bola Tinubu. NANS, the umbrella body of Nigerian students at home and in the Diaspora, in a statement signed by its Vice-President, External Affairs, Akinteye Babatunde Afeez, expressed satisfaction with the sack of CBN Governor and commended his subsequent arrest by the Department of State Security (DSS). The statement reads, “NANS agree and express satisfaction in the recent suspension of Godwin Emefiele from governing the affairs of the nation’s national bank, the Central Bank, by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “….Mr. Emefiele Godwin has afflicted heinous economic afflictions on the people generally and particularly the Nigerian students amongst other youths at home and in the diaspora, the fall of the naira, design and implementation of the new naira, amongst other failed policies. As the students association expresses support for moves by President Tinubu to correct some wrongdoing perpetrated by the ex-CBN governor, it appealed to the Federal Government to introduce measures that will ease learning in the country and make Foreign Exchange easier for Diaspora students. “We are pleased with how governance of the day has faired since the inception of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinbubu as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and we are hopeful for a better future.”
