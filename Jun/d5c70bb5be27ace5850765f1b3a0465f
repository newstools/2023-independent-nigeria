A group of men suspected to be political thugs allegedly sponsored by an opposition party have reportedly vandalised a campaign office donated by Adamu Garba II for the Tinubu-Shettima 2023 political activities in Yola-North LGA. Adamu is a chieftain of the APC and CEO of IPI Group Limited, (a tech conglomerate). The campaign office, which he said had been decorated to perfection, was allegedly targeted for destruction under the instructions of certain leaders of the opposition party. Adamu quoted Eyewitnesses to have revealed that: “The men were armed and openly defaced the office by smashing glass windows and doors. “The incident has been reported to the Nigerian police force, and an investigation has been initiated to bring the culprits to justice”. POLL Adamu Garba II, a Nigerian entrepreneur, IT expert, business consultant, and politician, expressed his disappointment and anger even as he condemned the act and demanded that those responsible be brought to justice. “Many have condemned the act, calling it undemocratic and uncivilized. It is unacceptable to indulge in vandalism and destruction of property, especially in a democratic society where we cherish free speech and the right to political activities. The incident has caused anger among the people of Adamawa State and has been condemned by politicians, business leaders, and members of the general public”. The campaign office situated in Yola-North LGA, was the best-decorated office in Adamawa State, according to reports.
