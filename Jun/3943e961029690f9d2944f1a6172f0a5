Asisat Oshoala, the Super Falcons and FC Barcelona Femini forward has said that the serial African champions would enter the 2023 Women’s World Cup with the mindset of reaching the final. The two-time UEFA Women’s Champions League winner said this to our correspondent on the sideline of an event in Lagos where she was unveiled as the brand ambassador of Multichoice. She noted that the players were looking forward to the World Cup in New Zealand and Australia, saying that they would take every game as it comes, although with the aim of seeing whether they would make it to the final. “Pertaining to the World Cup, we are not really setting a target but we are going to take every game as they come. “But I can assure you that we have our sight set on perhaps qualifying for the final; it is possible but first thing is that we are going to enjoy ourselves and fight to justify wearing the Nigerian colour. “You know whenever you wear that jersey, you are demonstrating one hundred and one percent commitment to the country and that is exactly what we are going to do. “We are preparing to represent Nigeria well and justify why we’re called to the national team,” he said. Nigeria is in Group B with the co-host, Australia, Canada and Republic of Ireland and the Super Falcons will open their games against Canada on July 21.
