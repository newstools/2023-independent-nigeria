KATSINA – Despite the challenges of the nonavailability of Visas, the Katsina State Pilgrims Welfare Board has so far airlifted about 3,000 Pilgrims to the holy land, promising that, the exercise will be completed as scheduled. Alhaji Suleiman Nuhu Kuki, the Executive Director of the Board disclosed this in an interview with Sunday Independent in Katsina on Friday. Kuki said the board had to stop the operations for a while owing to a lack of visas for the Pilgrims which he attributed to NAHCON Abuja. According to him, NAHCON as the supervising body must give approval before the state Pilgrims Board print out the Visas for the intending Pilgrims, as without the Visa they can’t be airlifted. He however revealed that, the Board has received over 1,000 Visas to enable it to continue the smooth Hajj operations exercise in the state. Apart from the visa issue, he said Katsina state is amongst the states with the highest number of Pilgrims presently in the Holy Land. The Pilgrims boss appreciated and acknowledged the support and cooperation of Governor Dikko Umar Radda towards the entire Hajj exercise inspired by the coincidence with his Inaugural ceremony. “Governor Dikko Umar Radda has been very supportive towards ensuring that all the necessary assistance were been extended to the Board to facilitate the smooth and successful conduct of the Hajj exercise in the state”, he posited. POLL To the Hajj stakeholders, Kuki commended them for their immense contributions, stressing that, so far, the board has achieved quite a lot in the smooth conduct of the 2023 Hajj operations. “I am very optimistic that this year’s Hajj exercise will be completed as scheduled before the closing date, as efforts are geared towards achieving that target, in Sha Allah”, he concluded.
