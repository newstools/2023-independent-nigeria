Barcelona have been rocked by Lionel Messi’s decision to join Inter Miami in the coming summer. However, Messi’s rejection could pave the way for the club to explore other options in the market. According to SPORT, one of the targets Barcelona are pursuing is Bernardo Silva. The Portuguese international is apparently keen on leaving Etihad at the end of the season and would be interested in a move to Spain. Silva, whose market value stands at €80 million, has been on Barcelona’s radar for a long time. He was notably linked with a move to Camp Nou last summer, but the move did not materialise as Barcelona did not have the financial strength to pull off the deal. However, the report points out Barcelona are likely to suffer from a similar issue this time out. The club do not have the economic strength to pursue Silva and must offload a bunch of players if they are to secure a deal for the Portuguese international. To make things worse, PSG are interested in the services of Silva. The French giants are ready to make a move for the Man City superstar ahead of the new season, as part of the club’s plans to rejig their attacking unit following the exit of Lionel Messi. Barcelona are not in a position to compete with PSG for Silva. They cannot match PSG’s economic offer for the Portuguese international, both in terms of transfer fee and the player’s contract. Hence, the Blaugrana see the attacking midfielder’s signing as ‘very difficult’. Silva, for his part, wanted to move to Spain, but he has made peace with the fact that PSG could be his next destination, as he moves closer to exiting the Etihad this summer. Barcelona, therefore, must shift their attention to other alternatives in the market as they look to beef up their options in the creative department.
