LAGOS – Nigerian top boxer, Jeremiah Okorodudu is dead. He died Wednesday evening in a private hospital in Lawanson, Surulere, Lagos where he has been receiving treatment for partial stroke and foot cancer. Confirming his death to our correspondent, his wife, Mrs. Adenike Okorodudu noted that his condition worsened Wednesday afternoon and all efforts by the doctors to revive him proved abortive. It would be recalled that the family of the ex-Olympian last week sent a ‘Save Our Soul’ message to Nigerians appealing for financial help as their breadwinner is about being sent out of the Lawanson, Lagos private hospital where he is receiving treatment due to the nonavailability of funds to take care of his medication and settle his accumulated medical bills.Prior to that, Okorodudu had earlier pleaded with sports-loving Nigerians not to watch him die a painful and agonizing death. It would also be recalled that the Sports Ministry terminated the once flamboyant boxer’s appointment as assistant boxing coach before his predicament began. The immediate past Minister of Sports and Youth Development, Sunday Dare failed to fulfill his promise of reinstating the ex -flamboyant middleweight boxing champion in the Ministry and at a time directed former African queen of the tracks, Mary Onyali- Omagbemi to close up on Jerry’s situation but nothing came out if it and Jerry before his death, lamented that there was no word from Dare or Onyali.
