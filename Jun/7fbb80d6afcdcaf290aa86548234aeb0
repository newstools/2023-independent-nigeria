LAGOS  – The International Society of Dip­lomats (ISD) Special Emissary on Media to Nigeria, Ambassa­dor Victor Asije, has called on developing countries to emulate China in the development of their domestic, inbound and outbound tourism potential. Asije disclosed this in a state­ment made available to Daily Inde­pendent in Lagos on Sunday. He said that China’s commit­ment to the development of do­mestic, inbound and outbound tourism potential has remained a major source of revenue and foreign exchange for national de­velopment and construction. The Special Emissary, who just returned from a mission to China, commended the Chinese govern­ment and peoples for harnessing the huge socio-economic oppor­tunities in tourism development. “There is really a lot for develop­ing countries to learn from the Chi­nese government and peoples, who are currently taking lovable advan­tages of their country’s tourism sites. “It is on record that China has made significant progress in the development of her inbound tourism alone with tourist arrival rising from 1,809,2million in 1978 to 145,307,8million in 2019. “Apart from the revenue the Chinese government and people are making from tourism, old ,young Chinese and tourists from other countries are looking re­freshed, healthy and more knowl­edgeable after visiting China’s historical sites. “China’s tourism industry is currently also providing enthu­siastic Chinese and non-Chinese jobs, as tour guides, taxis and bus operators, travel agents, hoteliers and hotel attendants, traders, translators, food vendors and many other areas of engage­ments,” he said. POLL According to him, develop­ing countries will reduce pov­erty, conflicts, crime, diseases, under-development, dearth of ideas, unemployment and other socio-economic challenges, if they emulate China in the development of their tourism industry.
