Globacom, the telecom­munications company has congratulated the Muslim Ummah in Nigeria on the occasion of the 2023 El-Kabir festival, just as it admon­ished them to rededicate themselves to the services of Allah. The company, in a state­ment issued in Lagos, urged them to seize the opportuni­ty of the annual festival to promote good neighbourli­ness, love and unity. The statement added: “’It is a season of charity, peace-making and forgive­ness. We must use this sea­son to remember to fend for the poor and the needy in line with Allah’s injunc­tion to be our brother’s keeper.” While wishing the Mus­lims a happy Eid celebra­tion, Globacom enjoined them to continue to cultivate the spirit of self-restraint and rededicate themselves to the service of Allah and extend love to other compa­triots across the country. The total telecommuni­cations services provider extended felicitations to Muslims who successfully performed the pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina in compliance with the in­junctions of the Islamic faith, similarly charging them to practice the vir­tues of commitment, dedi­cation and obedience which Prophet Ibrahim exhibited by his preparedness to offer Ismail, his son as sacrifice in obedience to the will of Allah, which the festival of Eid-El-Kabir commem­orates.
