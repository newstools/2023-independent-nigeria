BUREAU CHIEF BENIN – Edo State First Lady, Mrs. Betsy Obaseki; wife of State Deputy Governor, Mrs. Maryann Shai­bu, and a former Minister of Women Affairs and Social De­velopment, Josephine Anenih, have led women from the 18 local government areas of the State to the Secretariat of the Edo State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to advocate for more roles for women in politics and gover­nance in the State, ahead of the Local Government elections in the State. While addressing the Edo PDP chairman, Anthony Aziegbemi, and other leaders of the party, at the Secretariat in Benin City, Mrs Obaseki said more women should be given the opportunity to contribute their quota to the growth and develop­ment of the society. Commending Edo women for their roles in the re-election of Governor Godwin Obaseki in the 2020 governorship election and the 2023 Edo House Assembly elections, the First Lady charged the party to reward the efforts of the women with more opportu­nities for elective and appointive positions. “We are here today to advo­cate and push for more women to benefit from political and elective positions in this government. When we had the governorship election in 2020, the leadership of the party acknowledged the role women played to ensure the Governor won his second term but the women were not com­pensated. “We thank the Governor, his government and the party for the favourable and progressive policy under the leadership of Governor Obaseki and for mak­ing the nomination form free for women. This is the right step in the right direction. “We thank you, your Excellen­cy, for creating the platform for women to contest for chairman­ship positions in the last local government primary elections. “We appeal to the leadership of the party; we want more chair­manship, vice-chairmanship, councillorship, supervisory councillorship and other posi­tions for women.”
