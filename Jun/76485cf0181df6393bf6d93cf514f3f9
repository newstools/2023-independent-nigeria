The Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) on Thursday told the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC), that its activities have been banned by the Lagos State government. The Union also told the NLC and TUC that it is fully operational in the state. NLC and TUC had written to the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, threatening to mobilise its members for industrial action, if it fails to obey court order and remove all the barricades and armed policemen stationed at the offices of RTEAN by May 30. But in a letter to the leadership of NLC and TUC, dated May 31, RTEAN’s acting National President and Secretary Comrades Augustine Olajide Akhigbe and Anere Afam Celestine, respectively, said the national executive committee of the association was dissolved in March this year and replaced with acting one appointed to pilot its affairs. Part of the letter reads: “It is pertinent to put the record straight that in Lagos State, Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria are fully functional.” It added an electoral committee has been set up to conduct election in line with the union’s constitution. RTEAN denied that its “office in Lagos State is not under siege,” adding that the “union activities is running on daily basis.” According to the letter, none of RTEAN’s offices across the state or the two buses belonging to TUC, was seized. POLL RTEAN has therefore advised that the organised labour should trade with caution.
