The Ogun State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has alleged that the All Progressives Party (APC) and the Nigeria Police are frustrat­ing the ongoing investigation into vote-buying allegedly per­petrated by the ruling party across the state during the last governorship election. Consequent upon the March 18 governorship elec­tion held in the state, the can­didate of the PDP, Oladipupo Adebutu, had alleged that the ruling party committed electoral malpractices in an attempt to rig him out. In a press statement recently signed by the Ogun PDP chair­man, Sikirulai Ogundele, and made available to journalists, the party said it is not oblivious of an alleged plot by the APC in connivance with the police to scuttle investigations. “The Ogun State PDP is aware that All Progressives Congress (APC), Ogun State chapter and its candidate at the March 18, 2023 Ogun guber­natorial election, Dapo Abio­dun, are putting unbearable pressure on the police aimed at intimidating and frustrating them in its ongoing investiga­tion of the massive vote buying scheme perpetrated at the last Governorship and State As­sembly election across Ogun State by APC and coordinated by an Ijebu businessman with direct funding from the coffers of the Ogun State in a bid to stunt the investigation and to reveal the drain on Ogun State public finances used to fund Dapo Abiodun personal am­bition to the detriment of the majority of indigenes of Ogun State. A waste of the collective patrimony of Ogun State. “They are hereby warned to desist from acts geared at jeopardizing the ongoing investigation which will un­ravel and reveal who really in­dulged in voters’ inducement prior to and vote buying at the Ogun governorship election with a view of bringing the offenders to book.
