LAGOS  – Ahead of the commem­oration of June 12, Democracy Day, Dr. Obayuwana Osagie, President of the Centre for De­fence of Human Rights (CDHR) has said that the key to deepen­ing the nation’s democracy is by promoting popular participation in governance. Osagie, in a chat with Satur­day INDEPENDENT, said that a deepened democracy doesn’t allow for the imposition of pol­icies on the citizens. While assessing Nigeria’s democratic experience, Osagie said, “What we have so far is that those who find themselves in office no matter how credible the process was, run everything themselves and their acolytes, meanwhile what is at stake is the administration of public affairs. “The trade unions must be involved in policy formulation. Professional groups must also be involved. Nigeria Medical Asso­ciation, engineers, architects, nurses, lawyers’ etcetera, should be involved as far as budget mak­ing is concerned and general pol­icy formulation. “A deepened democracy doesn’t allow for the imposition of policy by the small circle of those who find themselves in of­fice. The youths, students are old enough to vote in elections, their views must be sought before pol­icies that affect them are made. The entire Nigerians, farmers, artisans, traders must be in­volved because it is our country. He added, “We don’t agree that Western democracy is the best attainable. We must involve the public in the management of public affairs. It is not only during elections but in between elections. It is the only way that we can talk about deepening our democracy. “It is also the only way we can curb corruption and abuse of office. We must go out of our way to enlighten the populace, to know that deepening democ­racy involves participation by them. “A purposeful leadership trains the people to be critical, to believe that it is the most ef­fective way of efficiently using our meagre resources. So, deci­sions as to what is to be invested should be taken after proper scrutiny and agreement.”
