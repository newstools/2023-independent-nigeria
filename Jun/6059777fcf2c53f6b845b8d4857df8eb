Juventus are “negotiating” with Leicester City for defender Timothy Castagne, it has been claimed. The Italian giants are said to have “held contacts” with City over a deal for the versatile full-back, who looks set to move on this summer after relegation to the Championship. According to Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio, Leicester want €15million (£12.8m) for Castagne, with Juventus reportedly confident they can negotiate the price tag down. Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri has already approved of the transfer, it is said, and a move could develop quickly. Leicester now have a manager in place with the arrival of Enzo Maresca, so transfer plans – both in and out – can now be ramped up.

While the Belgian continues to be linked with a switch to north London, a move to Italy now looks more likely if negotiations are underway and an asking price set. It would not be the first time Castagne has played in Italy. He joined City from Atalanta in September 2020, having made 96 appearances for the Italian club over three seasons. Since moving to England, he has made 112 appearances for Leicester, winning the FA Cup and Community Shield during that time.
