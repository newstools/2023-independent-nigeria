LAGOS  – The case of infringement on fundamental human rights filed by His Royal Highness, Oba Olatunde Oginni, over the destruction of his prop­erties worth millions of Naira took a dramatic turn as the management of the University College Hospital (UCH) instituted a petition against him but got turned down by the Police. The Chief Medical Di­rector (CMD) of UCH, Prof. Jesse Otegbayo, was sighted at the State Investigation Department, State (CID) Iya­ganku Ibadan, on Tuesday, June 13, 2023, and investiga­tion revealed that he was in­vited for questioning by the Police because the matter raised in the UCH’s petition has already been treated in the High Court of Justice, Ring Road, Ibadan. The monarch, when con­tacted, said he had respond­ed to the Police over the peti­tion written by UCH against him by informing them that the matter under the refer­ence is pending in court with suit number: 392/2023 from the University College Hos­pital Board of Management. The traditional leader and business mogul, howev­er, commended the Commis­sioner of Police, Oyo State Command, the Deputy Com­missioner of Police (SCID), Iyaganku Ibadan, and the officers of the SCID for up­holding the rule of law and not allowing it to be used. “I want to use the oppor­tunity to appreciate the Com­missioner of Police, Oyo State, and the leadership of Oyo State CID for upholding the rule of law and standing by the truth,” he noted. When the Public Rela­tions Officer (PRO) of UCH, Mrs. Funmilola Adetuyibi, was contacted for her reac­tion on the matter, she de­clined to comment, saying she does not have anything to say concerning the matter for now.
