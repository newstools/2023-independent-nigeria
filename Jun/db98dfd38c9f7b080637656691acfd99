The Managing Director, Hydroelectric Power Producing Areas Development Commission (HYPPADEC), Abubakar Sadiq, on Tuesday in Abuja, said HYPPADEC has identified and addressed problems bedeviling states affected by the impact of dams. He also revealed that the Commission has been able to establish areas and states offices in all affected states of the Commission. It also identified 1,485 communities affected by rivers flooding their banks, as he added that the commission was also able to set up one school in the 55 local government areas which fall under the commissionâ€™s mandate. Sadiq stated this while fielding questions at a three day capacity building workshop organized for staff of the commission. He explained that HYPPADEC has constructed over 200 solar powered boreholes, among others, adding that over 50,000 patients have benefitted from the healthcare it provided, among other public centred projects it carried out. He said the hydro commission recorded a significant reduction in perennial flooding incidents that ravaged communities in riverine areas, as he disclosed channelization has helped to reduce casualties. On the recent electricity bill signed into law by President Bola Tinubu, he said that the five percent reserved for host communities of generating plants is commendable, insisting that it will assist in developing the affected areas.
