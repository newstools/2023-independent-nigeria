LAGOS – Top ICT media practitioners and pioneers in Nigeria have launched a Foundation known as Cloud Net­work Foundation, (CNF), to drive advocacy for skills acquisition and capacity building among youths and push for policy that encourages local content in ICT development in Nigeria. The Foundation, made of the first eleven in ICT journalism in Nigeria, is worried that, among others, poli­cy direction and implementation in the country has primarily neglected local content development and the creation of the requisite skills and enablement for Nigeria’s teeming youth to excel in the ICT ecosystem. Mr. Abimbola Tooki, Chairman of the Foundation, who remarked at the body’s inaugural meeting, said Nigeria has so much untapped po­tential that, when harnessed by the provision of the right policies and strategies, could replicate anoth­er Silicon Valley in California, the United States to Bangalore in India. “We can move from a consum­ing nation to a producing one in a few years in the ICT ecosystem, and over 20 million of our youths can be lifted out of poverty every year if they have the right information, guidance, enabling environment and skills at their disposal if we take the right steps”, Tooki said. He said if the government prior­itised integrating technology (ICT) infrastructure into public service delivery to promote growth-orient­ed policies, it would be easier for all tiers and arms of government to collaborate to pull Nigerians out of poverty.
