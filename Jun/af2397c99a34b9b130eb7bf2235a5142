Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, the Labour Party (LP) governorship candidate in Lagos State in the recently concluded gubernatorial election, has said that Governor Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu should be disqualified and subsequently sent to one year imprisonment for allegedly voting on the Election Day without a permanent voter card in the 2023 governorship election. The gubernatorial candidate, in a tweet on his tweeter handle, alleged that the governor never had his PVC and that he voted without same on the day of the election, calling for a legal action against Sanwo-Olu. Rhodes-Vivour tweeted: “According to Electoral Act, Sanwo-Olu must be convicted and send to one year imprisonment and 100,000 fine for committing electoral fraud and malpractice.” The LP candidate had earlier hosted a tweeter space on Monday where our correspondent attended where he said that it was tabled in the Lagos election tribunal that the governor voted without a PVC and thus committed and offense which the Electoral Act placed as punishment one year imprisonment or a fine of N100,000 or both. “He voted without a PVC and it was tabled today (Monday). All eyes are on judiciary to ensure that this fraud never go unpunished,” he has said.
