ADO-EKITI  – The family of a chronic kid­ney disease patient, Mrs. Omobolanle Omoyajowo, has sought donations from spirited Nigerians to raise N20 million (30,000 dollars) for transport. The woman, a profes­sional caterer, has been di­agnosed to be suffering from acute kidney failure, hence requires an urgent Kidney Transplant to save her life. She was diagnosed with CKD (chronic kidney dis­ease) in November 2022 and has been on treatments and dialysis since then. She’s recently been ad­vised by her doctor to start preparing for a kidney transplant as the recent tests that were carried out indicate that her two kid­neys are no longer function­ing normally. So far, we’ve raised a quarter of that, and any­thing you can give would be a real blessing. To make a donation, please pay into her GTB account, Ayeni Esther Omobolanle – 0429774589. Thank you so much. As you know, Omobolan­le has always been there for us. She’s known to lend a helping hand whenever she could, monetary or kind. Now it’s time for us to be there for Omobolanle. The kidney patient, who hails from Odo Ayedun -Ekiti, is currently at Hos­pital: Clinix Health Diag­nostic Centre, Block Xii, Plot B Alh. Adejumo Ave, Anthony, Lagos.
