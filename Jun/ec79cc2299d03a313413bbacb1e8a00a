ABUJA  – As Nigeria marks the 30th anni­versary of the annulment of the June 12, 1993, Presidential elec­tions, Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA) has charged President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to increase the minimum wage for all catego­ries of workers and also ensure that his administration works to protect and defend citizens’ dem­ocratic rights. In a statement signed by Zikora Ibeh, CAPPA’s Policy and Research Officer, which made available to journalists over the weekend, the group stressed that the only way citizens’ longstand­ing aspirations and hope in true democracy, encapsulated in the long-drawn struggle against the de-annulment of June 12 can be met, is when Nigerians can choose their leaders in a free, fair, and transparent process devoid of violence, ethnic and religious hatred. The group said the President can demonstrate his avowed be­lief in democracy if he selflessly delivers the dividends of democ­racy to all Nigerians regardless of social status or ethnic, reli­gious and political affiliation. The statement quoted the CAPPA’s Executive Director, Oluwafemi Akinbode, as saying that “June 12 stands as a symbol of Nigerians’ steadfast struggle against military despotism and for democratic governance While it 1s important to recognize and honour the heroes of this re­markable struggle, as past re­gimes have done, we believe that far more important is the need for Nigerians to fully enjoy their democratic rights in the selection of who governs them “They also must begin to feel the dividends of democracy for which they sweated, struggled and died during those long years of street battles and protests against the military rule”. Akinbode said “It has been over 24 years since democratic rule was restored in Nigeria, but it 1s arguable whether the form of governance that exists in Nigeria today can be described as a de­mocracy or simply civilian rule. “while there has been some marked progress in terms of a thriving multiparty democracy and regular elections, Nigeria’s record of human rights viola­tions has not fundamentally improved. “Instead, since 1999, Nigeria has experienced systematic at­tacks on democratic rights, at­tacks on the opposition, shrink­ing civic space, arbitrary arrests, illegal detentions, torture and extrajudicial killings by security agents, as well as suppression of the rights to freedom of expres­sion and assembly, violation of the principles of separation of powers, assault on the judiciary and press freedom. POLL “More worrisome is the fact that every elected government since 1999, at the Federal or state level, has habitually disregarded Chapter 2 of the 1999 Constitu­tion (As Amended), which clear­ly outlines the social contract between the State and the people with regards to the funding of public education, healthcare, liv­ing wages, and the provision of adequate jobs and shelter.”
