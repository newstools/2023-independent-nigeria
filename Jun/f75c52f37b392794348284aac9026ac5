IBADAN – The Oyo State House of As­sembly during its plenary has okayed five commis­sioners among the names submitted for screening by the State Government.

Five out of the seven com­missioners designate that were screened including Prof. Kehinde Sangodoyin, Temi­lolu Ashamu, Fausat Ajoke, Adebisi Adeniyi Akinola Ojo were screened by the House, while Prof. Musibau Babatunde, and Toyin Balo­gun were unscreened due to avoidable absence. The House has also direct­ed the seven-man committee to inquire into the persistent killing of innocent citizens at border communities in the state at the sitting presided by the speaker, Adebo Ogun­doyin at the hallowed Cham­bers, Secretariat, Ibadan.
