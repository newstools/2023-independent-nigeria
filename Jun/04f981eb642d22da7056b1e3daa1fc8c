ASABA â€“ Bendel Insurance emerged winners of the 2022/23 NFF/Tingo Federation Cup after defeating Rangers Football Club of Enugu, by a lone goal, in the final held at the Stephen Keshi stadium, Asaba on Wednesday. The fixture which marked over 4 decades since both teams last met at this stage of the competition, proved to be a difficult affair as both teams tried to outwit each other, with Rangers having the first action of the half, with an attempt which hit the side netting. The next action of the half provided the major talking point the game, as Chinemerem Ugbwueze of Rangers handled the ball inside his box, conceding a penalty while earning a second booking and his marching orders. Imade Osarenkhoe carefully dispatched the spot kick to put the Benin side in front. After the interval, Rangers unsuccessfully tried to draw level, as they chased the game, and were fortunate not to concede more goals, with the goalkeeper pulling off saves to keep the scoreline. Edo Insurance held on to claim victory, which would provide some sort of consolation after they finished the regular season unbeaten with nothing to show for. Meanwhile, the victory also qualifies them to represent the country, alongside Rivers United at the CAF Confederations Cup. They also go home with #15 Million in their kitty, while Rangers received #7.5 Million, as runners-up. POLL Edo State Deputy Governor, Philip Shuaibu congratulated the team for winning the trophy and clinching a continental ticket while promising to further invest in the team.
