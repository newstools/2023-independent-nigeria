ENUGU – Ohanaeze, the apex Igbo Sociocultural organisation; Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, has expressed disappointment over the zoning arrangement for the leadership of the 10th National Assembly by the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. In the APC zoning plan, the northwest geopolitical zone was allocated a leadership position each in the Senate and House of Representatives. The party endorsed Tajudeen Abass from the Northwest as the House of Representatives speaker, and Benjamin Kalu from the Southeast as his deputy. In a statement made available to Journalists in Enugu on Friday by Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia, PhD. National Publicity Secretary, Ohanaeze Ndigbo said “The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has watched with grave concern the zoning of principal officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “We have also observed that the All Peoples Congress (APC) zoned the position of the Deputy Speaker to the South East of Nigeria. The Ohanaeze Ndigbo stated that allocating the position of the Deputy Speaker to the South East is highly unreflective, disgusting and provocative to the Igbo. “To this end, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide led by Chief Engr. Dr. Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, CFR (Ahaejiagamba) directs all the Igbo Lawmakers in the 10th National Assembly.
