Aston Villa transfer target Marco Asesnio will be heading to PSG this summer, according to reports in Spain. The Real Madrid ace will be leaving the Bernabeu in the coming weeks after joining the club seven years ago. He is set to become a free agent, and Villa boss Unai Emery was determined to make him his first signing of the window. In an update from AS, Asensio appears to have snubbed Villa’s advances, and is instead set to become a PSG player upon the expiration of his Madrid contract. Well-placed sources in Spain told BirminghamLive that Emery had opened dialogue with Asensio over a possible move to Villa Park, with the midfielder set to weigh up his options before playing his last game for Madrid this weekend. He is set to announce his departure from Madrid shortly, and will say his goodbyes to supporters in the home match against Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Asensio’s decision to join PSG would come as a blow to Villa, who will continue to aim for ambitious targets in the upcoming transfer window. Head coach Emery wants to improve all departments of his squad, but will not overhaul his team in one window. Villa must bolster their ranks after qualifying for European football for the first time since 2010. Emery wants his Villa side to be competitive in the Premier League, in the Europa Conference League and across the two domestic cups next season.
