A group, Ogun Integrity Van­guard (OIV), has asked the Peo­ple’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in the March 18 gov­ernorship election in Ogun State, Oladipupo Adebutu, to present himself for trial instead of writ­ing frivolous petitions to the Po­lice over his vote-buying scandal. According to OIV, it is dis­turbing that after the Federal Government had investigat­ed their vote-buying plot and charged them to court, Adebutu and some accused members of the PDP in Ogun State are now writing petitions to the Inspector General of Police ( IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, asking him to inves­tigate Governor Dapo Abiodun and the All Progressives Con­gress (APC) for vote-buying too. The group made its position known in a statement signed by its Secretary, Duro Thomas, and made available to newsmen in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capi­tal, on Monday. Thomas said: “It is a com­mon knowledge that following their alleged role in facilitating vote-buying during the March 18 governorship polls in Ogun State, the Federal Government charged Ladi Adebutu and a leading Deposit Money Bank, together with its Managing Director to court for alleged conspiracy, bribery and money laundering. “The charges, which were filed by the Director, Public Prosecutions of the Federation, M.B Abubakar; the Assistant Chief State Counsel, Aderonke Imana and Senior State Coun­sel, Bagudu Sani, on behalf of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Jus­tice, detailed how Adebutu and the co-accused “on or about 18th of March at Ibara, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, did allegedlly conspired among yourselves to corruptly give gifts, in order to induce vot­ers to endeavour the return of PDP candidates during the gu­bernatorial and state Assembly elections in Ogun State.
