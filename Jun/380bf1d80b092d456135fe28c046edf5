Another patient who needs just N5000 to get oxygen for one of her children received over N100,000 from the former Liverpool forward while he also supported two old men with another N100,000. Awoniyi’s many donations came after he had presented envelopes containing cash to several patients at the hospital receiving treatments.

While in the office of the CMD, Dr Bola Abdulkadir, thanked the Super Eagles striker for deeming it feat to visit the hospital to make donations to the patients.
