Dr. Solomon Arase, Chairman of the Police Service Commis­sion, and a former Inspector General of Police, on Wednes­day, met with the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC members serving in the Com­mission where he urged them to develop the will to contin­uously improve themselves and make an impact wherever they find themselves. Dr. Arase said they should keep asking themselves “in my little space, what have I contributed, what impact have I made” adding that they should not stop improving themselves since it is their in­tellectual depth that will take them far in life. He told them that Nigeria is in need of men and women who are visionary stressing that he wants to see great men and women from the Corps Members serving in the Com­mission. The PSC Chairman tasked them to key into the Securi­ty Sector Reforms and help win hearts and minds of the Members of the Public. He said they should also get into the conversation of how best to improve the Police/ youths relationship in Nigeria.
