Madonna has been discharged from the hospital and is now at home and feeling better after an intensive care stay. Madonna was admitted to intensive care for a serious bacterial infection last Sunday as revealed by her management team, Daily Mail reports. News of her ill health was shared by her manager, Guy Oseary, who said she had suffered a “serious bacterial infection”. The 64-year-old pop singer was due to begin a seven-month world tour in the coming weeks but has had to postpone it. It is not clear what initially caused Madonna’s infection, but doctors said it became extremely serious and required treatment in intensive care. Madonna, who is very private about health matters, was in the final stages of rehearsals ahead of her extensive 40th-anniversary world tour.
