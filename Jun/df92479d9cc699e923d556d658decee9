LAGOS – A non-government organization concerned about a cleaner environment, the Lagos Beach Cleaners, has embarked on the cleaning of the Secretariat-Oniru Beach, Victoria Island, Lagos. Mr. Israel Bonu, Founder and Executive Director of Lagos Beach Cleaners, in an interview with the Daily Independent, called for more actions than mere talks in ensuring safe, pollution-free environments and the sustenance of climate action. According to Bonu, the clean-up of Secretariat-Oniru Beach by Lagos Beach Cleaners was to commemorate two global events, namely World Environment Day 2023 and World Ocean Day 2023. He said: “The clean-up of Oniru Beach, Victoria Island, was in our bid to support the call for mobilizing transformative actions from every corner of the world by the United Nations. “We hosted a beach clean-up at Secretariat-Oniru Beach, Victoria Island, Lagos, on Saturday, June 10, 2023, to commemorate two important events. “These are World Environment Day and World Ocean Day 2023.” He described it as a huge success to rid Secretariat-Oniru Beach of filth and dangerous objects along the beach’s chores. “With our unbeatable, committed, and dedicated team of volunteers that includes children from the community, we did justice to the pollution on Secretariat-Oniru Beach by collecting 112.6kg of plastic and marine trash. The Lagos Beach Cleaners boss added. Collectively, let’s sustain the advocacy for climate action and fewer climate challenges.”
