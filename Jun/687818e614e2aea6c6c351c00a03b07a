Thursday, June 1, 2023, was one of the special days for the management staff and students of Nawair- Ud-Deen Senior High School, Ebute Metta, Lagos, Education District IV, as they took delivery of an HP office Jet Printer donated by Lagos Mainland Lions Club, District 404B-2 Nigeria in a colourful ceremony held at the school’s premises. The donation of the printer to the management of the school led by the principal, Mrs. Ikeade Sa­lami was performed by the President, Lagos Main­land Lions Club, District 404B-2 Nigeria, Lion So­larin-Akinyemi Morayo Oluyemisi. Though, the school has benefited from other projects carried out by the club and other social organisations, the donation of the printer will no doubt make a strong impact on the school and boost the students’ learning. Lion Solarin-Akinyemi speaking while pre­senting the printer to the school’s principal, Mrs. Salami, on behalf of Lagos Mainland Lions Club, noted that the donation of the printer was one of the numerous projects the club has embarked on in Yaba and the environs to better the community. She said the donation of the printer tagged Leg­acy Project for 2022-2023 Lions Service Year, was in line with Lagos Mainland Lions Club’s service to humanity, noting that apart from the printer proj­ect, the club has also supported health programmes, environment, pediatric cancer, diabetes, and youth empowerment aimed at achieving a healthy com­munity and nation at large. The principal of the school in her response de­scribed the donation of the printer as one of the beautiful things to have happened to the school and commended the members of the Lagos Mainland Lions Club District 404B-2 Nigeria for their un­flinching support to the school while calling on oth­er organisations to borrow a leaf from the gesture of the club to make Nigeria a better place for all.
