AC Milan have enquired about the possibility of signing Christian Pulisic as talks of finalising the deal for Ruben Loftus-Cheek continue in the last few days. The United Sattes forward has just a year left on his Chelsea contract but has told the board he wants out as he looks to get his club career back on track after largely being a fringe player in west London in the last two years. Chelsea are undertaking the biggest overhaul in their history, they have already agreed to sell Mateo Kovacic to Manchester City, and Kai Havertz to Arsenal while N’Golo Kante has ended his trophy-laden time at the club by signing for a club in Saudi Arabia. Ruben Loftus-Cheek who has been one of the players who came through the ranks at the club is closing in on a move to Milan where he will link up with former teammates Oliver Giroud and Fikayo Tomori. Milan are keen to sign Loftus-Cheek as a replacement for Italy international Sandro Tonali, who will join Newcastle United for £65m as Eddie Howe looks to build a team that can compete in the Champions League. That void created by the exit of Tonali will now be filled by the Loftus-Cheek but the interest in Pulisic is to fill an attacking role and provide cover for the fast-rising star in European football, Rafael Leao. Chelsea finished last season in 12th in the Premier League, their worst finish to the campaign in the last 25 years, and the new owners have seen their first plan of employing Graham Potter backfire and rectified that by hiring Mauricio Pochettino. The Blues have also confirmed the signing of Christopher Nkunku and Nicolas Jackson on long-term contracts.
