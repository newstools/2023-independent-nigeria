LAGOS –A human rights promoter, Amb. Kalu Ofon Emmanuel has told President Bola Ahmed Tinubu that the current parlous state of the nation’s economy does not allow him to have as many as twenty Special Advisers. Dr. Emmanuel, the Lagos State Chapter President, International Human Rights Protection Service, Florida, USA, who spoke to Sunday Independent at the weekend, maintained that since Mr. President will still have not less than 36 ministers. There is no need for him to appoint such a large number of Special Advisers. He noted that the president and the Vice President will also have a retinue of Senior Special Assistants (SSAs) and Special Assistants (SAs) for himself, the Vice President, and other top officials, it will not be wise to appoint as many as 20 Special Advisers who will still be cabinet members. Dr Emmanuel said: “The current cost of governance in Nigeria does not require 20 Special Advisers, besides the ministers. This is not acceptable at this time of financial squeeze. “The country and the citizens are undergoing serious hardship, suffering, hunger, and economic backwardness. “Engaging 20 Special Advisers is not a guarantee of miraculously transforming the economy. Let him reduce it to 10 advisers. “10 good heads could be better than 20 useless heads who will only help to squeeze and suffocate the economy.” “It is incumbent upon President Bola Tinubu to make good and better choices and have people around him to move the country forward. POLL “The President should also listen and implement good ideas to take the country to a better level.”
