LAFIA  – In preparation for bumper harvest in agriculture prod­ucts, the Federal Government and International Fund for Agricultural Development Programme (IFAD) assisted Value Chain Development Programme (VCDP), on Sun­day and distributed agricul­tural inputs to 363 smallholder Cassava and Rice farmers in Nasarawa State. Dr. Eunice Adgidzi, State Programme Coordinator, FG/ IFAD-VCDP, disclosed this during a flag-off of the 2023 wet season agricultural inputs dis­tribution exercise in Lafia the state capital She said that distribution of the agricultural inputs to the smallholder farmers was to improve their productivity and sustainability towards ensur­ing food security in the Nasar­awa State and the country. The programme State Co­ordinator explained that the smallholder farmers were at the centre of Nigeria’s food se­curity drive as they accounted for about 90 per cent of agricul­tural produce in the country. “However, these farmers have always been the prima­ry victims of threats to agri­culture including insecurity, climate change, and the rising cost of inputs among others. “These factors pose a grave threat to their productivity thereby leading to the current high rate of poverty among them, hence the need for the support,” she said. The programme coordina­tor said the 363 smallholder farmers were drawn from La­fia, Doma, Wanna, Nasarawa and Karu Local Government Areas of the State. She listed the items distrib­uted to include 1, 800 kg of im­proved rice seeds, 1,650 bundles of cassava stems, 402 bags of fertilizers (NPK and Urea) as well as 156 litres of selective and non-selective herbicides.
