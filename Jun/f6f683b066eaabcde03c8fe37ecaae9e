YENAGOA  – Bayelsa State Governor Douye Diri has described the death of media entrepreneur and own­er of Daar Communication Plc, Raymond Dokpesi, as a big loss to the Nigerian media industry and the country at large. Diri said this in a condo­lence message to the Dokpesi family, the management and staff of Daar Communication through his Chief Press Secre­tary, Mr Daniel Alabrah. He said that Nigeria had lost a media pathfinder, pas­sionate patriot, an unassum­ing bridge-builder and con­summate administrator. The Bayelsa governor not­ed that the late Dokpesi left in­delible marks in the broadcast media through his pioneering efforts as well as in politics. He said: “Dokpesi is fondly remembered for his candour, his unassuming personality and courage in his pioneering initiative in private broadcast media. “He left a mark as an icon in the democratisation of the media in Nigeria and as one who broadened the space for free speech among citizens. “Dokpesi was also noted for his strength of character and ability to build strong bridges of unity. He was a man who cherished and respected friendship either in politics or in business.”
