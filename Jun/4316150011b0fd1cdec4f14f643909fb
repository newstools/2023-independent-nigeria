Professional Football Association, PFAN, Kwara State chapter, on Tuesday, withdrew its suit at the Upper Ilorin Court, against the state football association, FA, after mediation talks by key stakeholders in the state. The withdrawal, therefore, paves the way for the scheduled June 13 FA elections to hold. PFAN, last Friday, dragged the FA to court, halting the elective Congress of the FA alleging that the soccer body unjustly committed it from the elective process. They also accused incumbent FA Chair, Idris Musa Abdullahi, aka, Thuraya of being high-handed and not carrying the playersâ€™ bodies along. PFAN, as unearthed by Daily Independent is a fractious body that has made it difficult for the accreditation committee of the FA to include it as a delegate given the numerous factions within its rank. Daily Independent on the ground in Kaiama reports that the election process is on. Sulaiman Ashafa, coach and chairman of the PFAN was spotted at the Pissio Hotel venue of the elective Congress in Kaiama. Thuraya will be squaring up for a second term but is being strongly challenged by Engr. Abdul-Lateef Olaide is a sports philanthropist with a vast interest in construction works.
