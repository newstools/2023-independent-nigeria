LAGOS – An officer of the Nigeria Immi­gration Service (NIS) attached to the Murtala Muhammed Inter­national Airport (MMIA), Lagos Command, has retrieved lost items belonging to a foreign pas­senger at the airport. A source close to the com­mand, confided in our corre­spondent over the weekend that no fewer than $5,000 credit cards and an Identification Number (ID) card of yet to be identified foreign passenger was retrieved at the Visa on Arrival (VoA) point of the command at the E-Wing Ar­rival section of the terminal last Sunday. Apart from the dollar currency, our correspondent also gathered that other foreign currencies were also retrieved by the officer. The source gave the name of the officer as Chief Immigration Assistant (CIA) Omodayo Ode­wenwa, who was recently rede­ployed to the Lagos International Airport from the Ikoyi Passport office. It was gathered that the items were discovered in a folder wallet on the floor around the VoA hall of the terminal. Our correspondent learnt that the command had escalated the incident by writing an email to the supposed owner, but as at the time of filing this report, it was yet to receive a response from the alleged owner of the items.
