LAGOS – Police operatives attached to Zone 2 Command, com­prising Lagos and Ogun states, with headquarters in Onikan, Lagos, said they have killed four suspected kidnappers during a gun duel with the mem­bers of the gang. The operatives said that four AK47 riffles, six maga­zines loaded with live ammu­nition, and one unregistered Bajaj motorcycle were recov­ered from the kidnappers after the exchange of gunfire. Hauwa Idris-Adamu, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Zone 2 Command, who confirmed this, said the incident happened in the forest along Ibara, Orile in Ogun State. Idris-Adamu, a Superinten­dent of Police (SP), said on May 6, 2023, at about 6 p.m., an intel­ligence report was received by the Assistant Inspector General of Police in charge of the Zone, AIG Ari Mohammed Ali, that a syndicate of kidnappers who had been terrorising Abeokuta, the capital of Ogun State, and its environs were seen at their sus­pected hideout. “Consequently, a team of detec­tives from the Zonal Monitoring Unit was mandated to go after the hoodlums. They swung into action and on sighting the Police in their hideout at a forest along Ibara Orile Ogun State, the kidnappers engaged the detectives in a gun duel during which four kidnap­pers were neutralised while others escaped with bullet wounds. “Thereafter, when the hide­out was later searched, one un­registered Bajaj Motorcycle, four AK47 rifles, six magazines loaded with 20 live ammunition, and 10 expended ammunition were re­covered. “Further investigation into the incident revealed that members of the syndicate were drawn from different parts of the country while some of them came from the neighboring countries of Ni­ger and Chad respectively. POLL “However, efforts are on top gear to arrest the other fleeing suspects while the investigation is in progress, please,” the police image maker added.
