LAGOS â€“ Hundreds of passengers bound for holy pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia are presently stranded at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos over the failure of Arik Air to airlift them as scheduled. Some of the pilgrims alleged that they have been stranded at the airport in the past four days, while all promises made to them by the airline had failed. The affected pilgrims were those of the private tour operators under the umbrella of Association of Hajj and Umrah Operators of Nigeria (AHUON). Some of the tour operators had booked Arik Air, one of the airlines approved by the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) for the airlift of pilgrims to the Holy Land for the 2023 pilgrim exercise. Our correspondent gathered that the airline had promised to bring an aircraft on Saturday morning from Saudi Arabia to airlift the pilgrims to the country, but failed to do so. As at Saturday morning, the pilgrims have stormed the office of the airline at the Lagos Airport, protesting the inability of the airline to be airlifed. One of the protesting pilgrims, Alhaji Waheed Adekunle, told our correspondent that they had been sleeping at the airport floors and mosque within the vicinity since July 14 2023. The pilgrim told our correspondent that all efforts to make Arik Air airlift them had failed and called on NAHCON to take decisive action on the airline. POLL There are also fears that the stranded pilgrims may miss the exercise.
