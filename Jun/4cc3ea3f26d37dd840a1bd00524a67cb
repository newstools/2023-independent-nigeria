First City Monument Bank (FCMB) has introduced a unique product, the FCMB Airtime Advance, to enable customers to borrow between N200 and N5,000 from their bank accounts to purchase airtime. The Airtime Advance solution aims to provide relief to customers who are in urgent need of airtime to make phone calls, send text messages or engage in other essential communication. Customers without FastCash loans can access the Airtime Advance based on eligibility by dialling FCMB’s USSD code of *329# or via the loan string *329*11#. The loan has flexible repayment, and it is taken from funds in the customer’s account. Customers can also purchase Airtime Advance for family, friends, and associates. Mrs. Yemisi Edun, Managing Director, FCMB at the product launch in Lagos, said the bank is “excited to take the lead as the first in the Nigerian banking industry to introduce an Airtime Advance product. “We want to support as many people as we can. It gives a lot of joy to realise that we are helping individuals, households, and businesses across the nation meet critical needs.” Mrs. Edun reiterated the bank’s commitment to delivering value-added digital banking solutions and superior customer experience. POLL Also, FCMB’s Divisional Head, Personal Banking, Shamsideen Fashola, said: “The Airtime Advance is a product of necessity.The inability to purchase airtime, which limits communication or getting disconnected during a call due to insufficient airtime, can be embarrassing. Our Airtime Advance solution will eliminate this, enabling more Nigerians to connect by having access to money to top-up their lines.” Fashola noted that the bank’s array of retail banking products would continue to resonate with the market, lifestyle and needs of the people. He promised that the Bank would continue to leverage technology and innovation to offer a seamless customer experience at its touchpoints.
