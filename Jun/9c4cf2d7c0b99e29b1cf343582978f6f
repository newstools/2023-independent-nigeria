Karim Benzema’s future at Real Madrid has gone under the microscope this week, following intense speculation that he has been close to signing for Saudi Arabian club Al-Ittihad However, latest reports have suggested that Benzema is now set to see out the remainder of his contract, which expires at the end of next season. Real Madrid are looking to sign a new striker regardless of whether Benzema stays or goes, although a backup option appears to be their main target, with Espanyol’s Joselu having been heavily linked. Rumours of Real Madrid being interested in Harry Kane have grown legs over the last couple of weeks, and Diario AS have now reported that the club want to sign the English international this summer, irrespective of whether Benzema remains for next season. Kane is almost certain to leave Tottenham Hotspur this summer, as he only has one year left on his current deal. With this in mind, Real Madrid could miss out on signing him if they don’t make their move this summer, and it appears that they are looking to do just that. It would be an interesting dynamic at Real Madrid if Kane signs and Benzema stays, as Carlo Ancelotti would have two of the best number nines in the world at his disposal. It wouldn’t be a bad problem to have, anyway.
