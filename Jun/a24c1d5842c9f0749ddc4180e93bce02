LAGOS – The Internet Exchange Point of Ni­geria (IXPN), a non-for-profit and membership-based organisation, which provides a platform where networks interconnect directly within Nigeria has highlighted the benefits that come with collaboration among operators, peering in carrier and cloud-neutral data centres and the hosting of content locally in Ni­geria, where it is believed does more downloads of content than uploads. The Chief Executive Officer of IXPN, Mr. Muhammed Rudman high­lighted these benefits to stakeholders at an exclusive peering workshop, which was organized by IXPN and Africa Data Centres (ADC) in collab­oration with Workonline Communi­cations. According to Muhammed, there is a lack of collaboration between the various operators in the ecosystem, which has led to duplication of infra­structure and ultimately, high cost of services for the end-users. “There is a lot of fragmentation in the industry. Despite the Nigeri­an Communications Commission’s framework for infrastructure shar­ing, industry players do not collabo­rate that is why we have duplication of infrastructure which are supposed to be shared,” he told Journalists on the sideline of the forum. Speaking on what peering in a car­rier and cloud-neutral data centres will bring to the industry and the Nigerian economy in general, Mr. Muhammed who is the immediate past President of the Nigeria Internet Registration Association (NIRA), said peering between Internet Exchange Point and a carrier/cloud-neutral data centres will enhance connec­tions for citizens and organisations alike, and help the economy to thrive.
