LAGOS – Not known back home in Nigeria, ‘King Kizzy’, whose real name is Kizzy Uzoma, is a Nigerian wrestler based in Dallas, Texas, USA. He breezed into the United State in 2006 and made his pro wrestling debut in 2021. Since then, he has been causing sleepless nights for the Texas Cowboy wrestlers both as a single competitor and on the tag team level. In a chat with our correspondent, Uzoma revealed his greatest achievement so far in the sport and his determination to take the sport to greater heights back home in Nigeria. He said: “Currently winning the DFW Tag team championship in Dallas, Texas alongside Donovan Pierce is my greatest achievement so far. I feel like it’s too early for me to be fulfilled. There is still a lot to do and accomplish. We haven’t even scratched the surface yet,” With little or no experience in Pro-wrestling, Uzoma left the shores of Nigeria for USA where he started training and carved a niche for himself. “While in Nigeria, I never saw the opportunity. It was only a farfetched dream until I moved to the United States. After completing my college education, I started searching for opportunities around me to take the first bold step into Pro Wrestling. In February 2020 right before the pandemic hit, I started training. He disclosed that he trained under Lamont Williams at DFW ALL PRO Wrestling Academy in Dallas, Texas. “He was and still my coach because training is forever. I trained alongside Carlos Diaz, Levi Lucas and Donovan Pierce (my tag partner) among others. “I never had any experience except wrestling with my brothers and friends in the living room back home in Nigeria before I travelled out,” he said. Uzoma hails from a royal family in Isunjaba, Isu Local Government Area of Imo State. “Everyone knows me as Kizzy. The King is a strong affirmation of where I came from and how I was raised. I have said this countless times. I was born to rule and dominate, to lead and not to follow and that is the truth,” he added.
