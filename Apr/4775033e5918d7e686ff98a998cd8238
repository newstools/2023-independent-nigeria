The Federal Government has once again been urged to encourage indigenous professionals to horn their skills and expand their scope by involving them in the execution of major contracts. A Chartered Land Surveyor, Mr. Fola Bodunrin dropped this hint in an exclusive interview with Daily Independent. According to him, the idea of giving out major contracts only to multinational companies to the detriment of local and ‘even more competent’ professionals was not something that should be allowed to continue. His words “It is very unfortunate and worrisome, that when the Federal Government wants to give out major contract jobs, it usually considers the multinational companies to the detriment of local professionals whose competence cannot be questioned”. He went on, “It is not only worrisome and detrimental but you would be surprised that some of these so-called foreign experts are nothing but technicians in their home country but when they come here, they are given different titles just to fit into the system”. Bodunrin equally frowned at a situation where these ‘foreign experts’ are made to supervise the indigenous professionals who more than often teach them the nitty-gritty of the job. He said that unless this discriminatory attitude towards the local professionals was quickly nipped in the bud, most of them would continue to seek greener pastures outside the country. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ According to him, no nation grows technologically when its local professionals are made ‘subservient’ to those that are not more qualified than them. POLL He pointed out that over the years professionals in the construction industry have been clamouring for the involvement of local professionals in the execution of major contract jobs awarded by the Federal Government. He added that government should hearken to this clarion call. He noted that by so doing, more and more indigenous professionals would be challenged to put in their best in service to their fatherland.
