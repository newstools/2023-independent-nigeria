The Central Bank of Nigeria has insisted that both the redesigned and old notes remain legal tender. The apex bank reiterated this on its social media platforms on Sunday while dismissing reports that it planned to phase out the newly redesigned N1, 000, N500 and N200 notes. The statement by its Ag. Director, Corporate Communications, Dr Isa AbdulMumim, allayed fear, saying that the speculation is an attempt to make citizens panic. “We wish to reiterate that the new and old currency notes have been circulating side by side just as the Bank has been taking delivery of a good quantity of the redesigned bank notes from the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Company Limited. “Furthermore, we are committed to supplying the approved indent for the smooth running of the economy. “We, therefore, urge members of the public to disregard any report suggesting a phase-out of the redesigned currency. For the avoidance of doubt, the redesigned and old notes will continue to be accepted as legal tender. “They will circulate side-by-side for transactions ahead of the December 31, 2023 deadline, when the old N1000, N500 and N200 banknotes will eventually be phased out,” the statement read.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
