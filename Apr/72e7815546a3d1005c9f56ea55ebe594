In the summer 2022 window, Newcastle United were repeatedly linked with Martin Terrier. The French media had claimed Leeds United and West Ham were the first two to try and sign the attacker, but their two offers of €30m and €35m weren’t close to making Rennes worry. Newcastle were then said to have offered more than €45m, with the Ligue 1 side still refusing to sell. -ADVERTISEMENT-Sunday’s edition of L’Equipe says that approach from the Magpies was actually worth €60m, which seems like a huge offer for the 26-year-old. Rennes may have been correct, though, because in 22 matches this season, Terrier scored 12 goals and contributed a further five assists.Unfortunately for Rennes and Terrier, the player ruptured a cruciate ligament in January and has therefore faced a long term absence. There’s a suggestion some feel it was a mistake to reject Newcastle and their big offer, and also to refuse to sell Lovro Majer to Atletico Madrid for €40m. Newcastle moved to other targets and will be pleased with how things are going. Given the injury, it’s unlikely the Magpies will return for Terrier.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
