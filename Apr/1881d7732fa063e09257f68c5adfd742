Former governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano, has felic­itated with Nigerians and the Muslim Ummah on the occasion of Eid el-Fitr. Obiano, in his Sallah goodwill message, charged Nigerians, especially Muslims, to pray for unity to achieve progress and economic stability. He said, “The Ramadan and Eid el-Fitr season symbolise faith, prayer and charity. As Is­lam encourages unity, I use the occasion to urge the Muslim faithful in Nigeria to be steadfast in working and praying for the peace, unity and progress of our beloved country. “Nigeria has been through a lot of trials. But this is a phase in our journey to the Promised Land. Regardless, the citizens have kept the tenets of their faith and have trudged on with renewed hope. We are a resilient people that can overcome any­thing, with unity.” He called on the populace to renew their faith in a united Nigeria, saying the country has already come a long way in the efforts towards stability. Obiano emphasised the im­portance of peace, unity and tol­erance among the diverse peoples of the country for development to take place, noting Nigeria’s di­versity as pivotal to sustainable progress. He urged Muslims to use the spiritual season to offer special prayers for the country against the backdrop of security and economic challenges.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “As we join the rest of the world to celebrate this year’s Sallah, I enjoin you to replicate and demonstrate in your daily lives the virtues of unity, sacri­fice, forgiveness, piety and gen­uine love towards one another. National unity will bring about positive national integration and strengthen our socio-cultural bonds,” he added.
