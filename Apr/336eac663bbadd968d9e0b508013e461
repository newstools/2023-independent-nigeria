DAMATURU – The Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, has called on Nigerians to use the Easter occasion to pray for a successful and peaceful transition of power as Ni­geria prepares for change of leadership. Governor Buni stated this in a goodwill message to the Christian faithful to mark the Easter occasion. He said it is very import­ant to internalise the values of love and sacrifice as re­flected in the teachings of Easter at this period of our national life. “The good lessons of love and sacrifice should be used to promote peace and uni­ty for the prosperity of the country and Nigerians,” he said. The governor noted that this is a blessed period when Christian faithful observe the Easter and a time when their Muslim brothers are observing the Ramadan fast. “It is, therefore, a great op­portunity for us as a nation to take advantage of this period to pray for our country,” Gov­ernor Buni advised. The governor called on religious and community leaders to always preach peace and peaceful coexis­tence.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “We can only practice our religions and achieve prosperity when we have peace. POLL “Some few years back, we could not go to mosques and churches in Yobe State due to security challenges. But today, we glorify God for the peace we now enjoy across the state. “We should, therefore, guard it jealously and avoid anything that could tamper with peace and security in Yobe State and Nigeria,” he advised.
