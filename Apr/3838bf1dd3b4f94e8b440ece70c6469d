Veteran Fuji artiste, Wasiu Ayinde, aka K1 De Ultimate, has made news headlines as his 49th album bears the same title as Davido’s fourth album, ‘Timeless’. The criticisms arose not only because of the similarities between the album titles but because of the timing of the release. Kwam 1’s album will be released on the 14th of April while Davido’s ‘Timeless‘ album was released on the 31st of March. Also, like Davido, the singer has announced an album pre-order sale on Apple Music. Reacting to this news, Davido’s fans and critics claimed the Fuji musician was attempting to exploit the accolades and waves trailing his (Davido’s) new album. Kwam 1 announced the completion of the recording of the new album on the 25th of August, 2022, in an Instagram post. The caption read, “All to the glory of God, as the recording of the Album ‘TIMELESS’ is now fully concluded and engineers can now continue work on mixing and mastering the said Album.” “Many thanks to members of my band for the long recording session and perseverance towards the perfection of the Album. Fans across the globe should anticipate this great masterpiece from The King of Fuji Music. Thank you, and God bless you all.” ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ On the other hand, one of Davido’s earliest mentions of his fourth album was during an interview with Rolling Stone magazine published in July 2022. He made no mention of the title or the exact release date. POLL But Davido did reveal that he would record the album in Lagos and that the “album will likely feature more marquee Amthe American acts, as well as African up-and-comers”. Davido revealed his album title and release date on 21 March-the same day he broke his four-month social media hiatus, which began in October 2022, when his son, Ifeanyi, died. Kwam 1’s ten-track album, published by Damjay Films & Records, is already on presale on Apple Music. The album has a total playtime of 105 minutes, and 9ice is the only artiste featured.
