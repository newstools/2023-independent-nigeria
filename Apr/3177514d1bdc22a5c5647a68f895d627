IBADAN  – A renowned Islamic scholar, Sheikh Hashim Atere, has warned Nigerians, especially elected public office holders, on the consequences of not keeping electoral promises. Atere gave the warning during the fifth annual Shina Peller/NUJ Ramadan lecture/ Iftar held at the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Press Centre in Ibadan. The annual lecture/Iftar is sponsored by the Ayedero of Yoruba land, Shina Pel­ler, member of the House of Representatives representing Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Kajola/Iwa­jowa. The lecture, entitled: “Ines­capable Rewards of Kept and Unkept Promises in Public Of­fices: The Islamic Perspective,” was well attended by journal­ists and politicians from across different religious groups. Atere warned elected pub­lic officers to always adhere to the bond between them and the electorate, saying that Al­mighty God frowns so much at unkept promises. He said every promise made was a debt that must be redeemed, saying that Allah considered not fulfilling prom­ises as a great sin. “Our public office holders should always know that they were elected based on prom­ises made to the people in the presence of God.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
