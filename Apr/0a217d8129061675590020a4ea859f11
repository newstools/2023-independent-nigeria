FC Barcelona continue their search for the best-fitted reinforcements for their goals of competing for more and more silverware come next season. Recent reports have stated that there are actually several positions that coach Xavi Hernandez would like reinforced, with an emphasis on creativity lacking in the squad when certain players are unavailable. A certain player that fits the bill and undoubtedly possesses the Barca DNA is current PSV Eindhoven midfielder and former La Masia prodigy Xavi Simons. The 19-year-old left the Catalan academy at the tender age of 16 after 6 years at the Blaugrana academy, his subsequent move to French side PSG did not particularly work out well for the youngster who was then sold off to Dutch side PSV. At the Dutch club, the player has found rejuvenated form and continues to impress as he did during his La Masia days. With 16 goals and 8 assists across all competitions, the player has shown brilliant quality while playing for his new club and even managed to win the Eredivisie Player of the Month award in March. He has also found success at the International stage. He became a more appreciated member of Louis Van Gaalâ€™s Netherlands squad and played during the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, and then a regular starter for the subsequent manager Ronald Koeman in his current selection of players. Barcelona realizes that they may not be able to compete with the likes of PSG when it comes to offering Simons a more compelling financial offer, but they believe that his love and history with Barcelona, alongside the Dutch pull of Jordi Cruyff would be a compelling offer to the youngster according to the recent reports from Mundo Deportivo. Moreover, the Catalan club intends to help him see his important role under Xavi Hernandez for next season should he decide to make that step towards a potential homecoming.
