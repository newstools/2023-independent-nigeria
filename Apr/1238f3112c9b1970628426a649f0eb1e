AWKA – There is angst in Peter Obi, Presidential candidate of Labour Party’s camp about what it perceives as  desperate attempts being made by the agents of All Progressives Congress (APC), in conjunction with Government agents to nail Obi by all means and drag his name into the amorphous group said to be angling for Interim Government. Daily Independentearnt that  Committee  made up of some Communications experts, headed by a well known Igbo hater (names witheld) which Obi group described as ‘our prodigal brother from Nnewi’ “to review all calls Obi made in the last three years, and especially now to see if he mentioned Interim Government or anything that will make them prosecute him for treason when and if  they take over”. My source said: “Till now, they are yet to see any. The badly doctored conversation  with Bishop Oyedepo released by the Igbo prodigal brother is the much they have discovered so far. “They edited out the Muslim-Muslim ticket that led to the discussion, where Obi said that in a society like ours, religious balancing was a necessary consideration and that their recklessness had made Christians to assume it was a religious war”. The purpose of editing out the portion  my source said, was to make the discussion look as if Obi was advocating moslem-moslem ticket as the reason why Interim Government is necessary. “The discussion was doctored to drag Obi into what they are looking for”, the source said.
