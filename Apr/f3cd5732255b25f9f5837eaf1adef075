LAGOS – CyberGirls Fellowship: 500 Females From 22 Countries Admitted Into Third Cohort CyberSafe Foundation has kicked off its third annual cohort of the CyberGirls fellowship program. The program has admitted 500 female cybersecurity enthusiasts aged between 18-28 years old from 22 African countries. The CyberGirls fellowship program is Africa’s largest female-focused free cybersecurity training and mentorship program, providing fellows with world-class training and mentorship to enable them to develop the skills they need to thrive in the cybersecurity industry. The program is an initiative of CyberSafe Foundation, a non-profit organization registered in the United States of America, committed to facilitating safe and inclusive access across Africa. The third cohort marks another milestone in CyberSafe Foundation’s efforts to close the gender diversity and inclusion gap which currently stands at only 9% female participation in the cybersecurity workforce This year’s cohort was selected from over 20,000 applications received from across Africa, highlighting the growing interest in cybersecurity among African women. To celebrate the launch of the third cohort, CyberSafe Foundation hosted a colourful orientation ceremony which took place at the Microsoft Auditorium, University of Strathmore, Nairobi, Kenya, on March 25. During the event, the new fellows had the opportunity to physically and virtually network with their peers in 21 other countries and learn more about the CyberGirls fellowship program.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Speaking to the new participants, Executive Director of CyberSafe Foundation, Confidence Staveley said: “We are thrilled to launch our third cohort of the CyberGirls fellowship program, which is designed to attract and empower young women across Africa to take on cybersecurity as a profession.
