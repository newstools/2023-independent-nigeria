Former Barcelona and Spain manager Luis Enrique arrived in London on Wednesday in order to meet Chelsea to discuss the vacant manager position at the Premier League club. Enrique’s arrival comes after former Chelsea boss Graham Potter was sacked on Sunday after just seven months in charge. Currently, Chelsea is 11th in the Premier League and has been eliminated from both the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup. The Blues are still in the Champions League and are set to face Real Madrid in the first leg of their quarterfinal at the Santiago Bernabeu on April 12. The 52-year-old Enrique has been out of a job since leaving his position as Spain coach after his team suffered a disappointing round of 16 exit at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Having become Spain’s coach in 2018, Enrique led the national side to the Euro 2020 semifinals as well as the 2021 Nations League Final. Now, the Spanish team is set to appear at the 2023 Nations League semifinals.
