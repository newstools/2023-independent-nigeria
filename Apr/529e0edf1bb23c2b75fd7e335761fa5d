The Governor-Elect of Cross River State, Senator (Prince) Bassey Otu, has ex­tended his warmest greet­ings to the people of Cross River State and Christians across the country on the occasion of the 2023 Easter celebration. Otu in his Easter mes­sage urged Cross Riverians to see the celebration as a moment of sober reflection and supplication for the state and Nigeria at large. The Governor-elect not­ed that Easter, believed to be the foundation of Chris­tian faith commemorating the resurrection of Jesus Christ, renews hope in man­kind. He urged Christians to imbibe the significant lessons of Easter and em­ulate the virtues of Christ as demonstrated in His life of sacrifice, tolerance, per­severance, patience, com­passion, humility, honesty, forgiveness, selflessness and love. “I wish all Cross Riveri­ans and Christians nation­wide a Happy and reward­ing Easter celebration. May the blessings of Eas­ter, which commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ, bring us hope, joy, happiness and peace! “Let us use this period to seek the face of God, reflect on the important lessons of Easter and pray for our dear state (Cross River) and Nige­ria in general as we prepare to transit from one admin­istration to another in the state and at the centre,” the Governor-Elect said. He assured Cross Riveri­ans that upon assumption of office as their governor come May 29, he would serve them with the fear of God and work tirelessly to take the state to the next level for the benefit of the people.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
