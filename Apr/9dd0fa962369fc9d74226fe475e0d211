In a bid to rescue Nigerians from Sudan, a private airline in Nigeria, Air Peace, has expressed its readiness to evacuate stranded Nigerians without a cost. This was disclosed in a statement on Monday by the Chairman and Chief Executive Office of the airline, Allen Onyema, adding that the airline would render help if the Federal Government can get them to a safe and secure airport in any of the neighbouring countries bordering Sudan. He said that Nigerian students and others stranded in the war-racked nation have urgent “needs our help.”Onyema said he is compelled to help because Nigeria cannot afford to lose her citizens in that country, adding that it would be his own commitment to making sure that the stranded Nigerians in the war-torn country are safe. “Again, Air Peace is willing to evacuate Nigerians stranded in Sudan free of charge if the government can get them to a safe and secure airport in any of the neighbouring countries bordering Sudan. Everything must not be left to the government and the government alone. “We are very ready to do it immediately. No time wasting. Any action that would promote national pride, national cohesion, peace and unity, we are for it. “Again, we have no apologies for believing in our nation and loving the nation despite certain national challenges. If they are moved to Kenya or Uganda or any other country, we will move in to get them out. Some parents have started calling on us to help. We are ready to do this again and again,” he said.
