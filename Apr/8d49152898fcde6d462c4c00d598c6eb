Mikel Arteta has admitted he is unsure whether William Saliba will be able to play again this season as fears grow at Arsenal over the severity of the defender’s back injury. Arsenal have been hoping that Saliba would be able to feature in next week’s crucial top-of-the-table clash against Manchester City, but that is now regarded as highly unlikely. Back injuries are often complicated to manage and Arteta said on Thursday that Saliba’s recovery has not been as smooth as the club’s medical team were hoping or expecting. The 22-year-old limped out of Arsenal’s Europa League defeat by Sporting Lisbon and has subsequently missed his club’s last four matches. Arsenal have not kept a clean sheet in any of those games. “We still have to wait a little bit more,” said Arteta of Saliba. “He is not progressing as quick as we hoped. It is a bit delicate and we want to be very certain when we push him that he is ready to absorb the load and the risk that we will take. At the moment that is not possible to do.” Asked whether Saliba’s problem could be an end-of-season injury, Arteta said: “I don’t know. It is a bit early to do [predictions]. Probably next week we are going to have more certainty.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “There is some evolution, he is doing more activity. But he is not there yet to start to throw him on the pitch at the level that the sessions demands, to compete in this league.” POLL Arsenal are more hopeful over the fitness of left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko, who missed Sunday’s draw at West Ham United with a tight groin but could return to the team for Friday’s match against Southampton.
