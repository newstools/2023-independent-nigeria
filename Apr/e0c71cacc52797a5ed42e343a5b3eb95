LAGOS – Former Presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the 2023 general elections, Prince Adewole Adebayo, has called for a reform of the Independent National Electrical Commission (INEC), saying that the kind of works the Commission is assigned to do are not the most important ones. Adebayo, who made the call on Thursday at the “Special Post-Mortem Roundtable On the 2023 Elections in Nigeria,” organised by the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA) at the Institute in Lagos on Thursday, lamented that “INEC is making up for failure of infrastructure, as well as failure of governance in many areas.”Noting that the theme of the event was apt, Adebayo added: “We are starting on time to examine our electoral processes, our politics and attitude to better governance in Nigeria.”He advised Nigerians to take responsibility for the elections, adding: “Nigerians are self aware, they know that we need our elections to be okay and we have stopped pretending that our elections are okay. That is self awareness.”He added: “People have to determine whether they want better governance or a four-yearly ritual that doesn’t improve their situation.”Commenting on letters to the International community by his colleagues in the election, Adebayo said: “We are trying to realize that Nigeria is a mature county and we can’t look outside for salvation. So, writing letters to Joe Biden, Tony Blair or whoever does not help matters.”While admitting that “INEC may not be able to deliver free, fair and credible elections because many of the factors that are outside its control,” Adebayo urged the Electoral Commission todo what it can afford to by being honest.He added that “Saying the truth is not outside their control.”According to him, “If everyone who is involved in the electoral process says the truth, as our Holy Books have admonished, that truth will educate INEC to know that the kind of assignment it needs to take and the one that it cannot do.”Adebayo, who said that Nigeria is a leading light in Africa, “so we don’t need to send foreigners to monitor our elections, added: “We should realize that Africa has the same problems on elections.”He said that “INEC is always to blame because it is the owner of the failed promises in the elections,” adding that It can constitute it’s own decision-making body, even as it has different interests in the political space.”“They give Nigerians fantastic promises but fail on election day,” he added.Also at the event, Africa’s leading scholar of Electoral Administration and Politics, Professor L. Adele Jinadu, said that Nigeria must wake up and take interest in politics.According to Prof. Jinadu: “We must take interest and organize ourselves to stop the things that we do not want in our political space.”While calling for the need to adopt a night watchman approach to politics in Nigeria generally, Jinadu suggested that external vigilance must be put in place. He said that since the citizens could provide alternative security for themselves since the state failed, they have to come together to guard the political environment. ‘The government has failed in politics, so we need to guard our political environment,” he added. Present at the event were Funsho Doherty, a governorship candidate in Lagos State election in 2023, retired diplomats, legal practitioners, among others.
