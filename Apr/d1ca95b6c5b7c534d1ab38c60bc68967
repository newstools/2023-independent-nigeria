Just as every finger is different, so also is every woman different. While some women favour a classic, simpletaste in their fashion, others are a little edgier in their style expression. The Classic Woman: She is drawn to, elegant, and timeless shoe options. She’s the girl who’d choose a simple over extravagant, and would rather stick to what she’s familiar with than make an unexpected statement. The Daring Woman: “There’s no point showing up if you wouldn’t be making a statement,” says the daring woman. She is the girl who goes beyond the norm and basks in the attention. To her, fashion should be daring or nothing at all, and she unapologetically wants to show this in her choice of shoes. The Shimmering Woman: Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle! If shimmer and shine were real, they collided in you. A walk through your closet and anyone can see the outfitsand shoes you’re drawn to all have something in common — embellishments. Whether it be sequins, crystals, or applique, rich details have pride of place in your outfits and your shoes sit in the same boat. The Edgy Woman: Spunky is the kingdom and you are certainly the queen. You’re the kind of woman who enjoys an unexpected style statement. Think exaggerated layering, 3D detailing, creative construction, and the like. As you proudly stand out from the pack, do so in the best shoes that match your taste.
