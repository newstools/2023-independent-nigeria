The Edo State Government has urged stakeholders to support initiatives and implementation of reforms that will ensure a cleaner, greener and healthier environment. Addressing journalists during a sensitisation pro­gramme to commemorate the 2023 World Earth Day, the Edo State Commissioner for Envi­ronment and Sustainability, Engr. Osasere Evbuomwan, urged stakeholders and groups to support campaigns to en­lighten members of the public on their roles in achieving a sustainable environment. He said the sensitization should focus on the need for proper disposal of wastes, ac­tivities that discourage defor­estation and other practices that degrade the environment. The commissioner said the damages to the environment through everyday practices and livelihoods have resulted in a drastic climatic change, which necessitates the need for taking proper care of the environment. He noted, “The climate has already changed. When it rains we should desist from doing things the way we are used to because once it rains and the gutters become unable to take the water out, the water will come back to your homes which will lead to serious dam­age, loss of lives and properties. “We encourage people to clear gutters in their neigh­borhoods and ensure your surroundings remain clean and green.” On his part, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Environ­ment and Sustainability, Joel Edionwe added that the state government is investing in the environment in all its facets to make Edo clean and green.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Also, president of Non-Gov­ernmental Organizations in Edo state, Abiola Daisy ap­pealed to stakeholders for the concerted effort to achieve a clean, healthy environment, noting, “Please let’s keep our environment clean. Let’s join hands to make sure the envi­ronment is clean. Let us desist from dumping our refuse in gutters and other unautho­rized/illegal dumpsites. A clean environment ensures better health for everyone and it starts with you and I.”
