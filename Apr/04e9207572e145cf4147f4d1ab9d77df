ABUJA – Presidential Candidate of Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, on Thursday through the Head of the Obi-Datti Media, Diran Onifade, dismissed rumors surrounding his ordeal with immigration officials in Heathrow Airport, London, saying that contrary to reports, the British government is yet to apologize to him. He stressed that he was yet to receive any letter of apology from the British government over his detention in the UK. DAILY INDEPENDENT reported that Obi was detained in London on April 7, over impersonation. However, on Thursday reports started circulating in a section of the media that the British authorities have apologised. But in a swift reaction to the development, the Head, Obi-Datti Media, said, “We have been receiving enquiries with regards to a so called apology, purportedly issued by the British Government or any of its agencies, to our Principal Mr Peter Obi, in respect of a routine Immigration engagement with him, as he arrived London, for a brief visit, last Friday, the 7th of April. “We would like to state emphatically that we are not aware of any such apology, and have not issued any statement whatsoever, in that regard. “While we continue to examine any dubious or political motive, on the part of the perpetrators of the identity theft, we have every confidence in the ability of the British authorities to resolve the matter to its conclusion”.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ According to him, Obi has since moved on from the incident and continues to be totally focused, on the legal processes before the Election Petition Tribunal towards the recovery of their mandate, which they are convinced was overwhelmingly expressed by voters, in the Presidential election of February 25.
