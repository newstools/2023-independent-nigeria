Rafael Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam champion in men’s tennis, withdrew from the Barcelona Open as the Spanish superstar is still struggling with a hip injury. “Barcelona is a special tournament for me, because it is my adopted club and because playing at home is always a unique feeling. “I am still not ready and, therefore, I continue my preparation process for the return to competition,” Nadal said on Twitter on Friday. Nadal, 36, was injured in his hip during the 2023 Australian Open in January. The same injury kept him out of the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters held on April 8-16 in Monaco. Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell will be held on April 17-23. Following the Australian Open, the first Grand Slam of the year, Nadal could not play at the Indian Wells Masters in California, Miami Open, and Monte-Carlo Masters. Nadal is one of the tennis greats, winning an all-time record 22 major titles in men’s singles, including a record 14 French Open championships. POLL Former world no. 1 Nadal now ranks 15th globally.
