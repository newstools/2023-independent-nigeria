MTN Nigeria Communications Plc, in celebration of Women’s Month, hosted a webinar on March 30, 2023 to explore how female-led SMEs can leverage technology to optimise their business processes, improve efficiency and drive growth. The webinar, themed, “Her Success in Business – Leveraging Tech in the Face of Multiple Demands”, is a conversation with some members of MTN Nigeria’s senior management team and an external author who shared their perspectives, experiences, and ideas on the best ways to scale a small business in a fast-changing technology world. According to International Finance Corporation (IFC), women own around 41% of businesses in Nigeria. However, female SMEs face various challenges including limited access to finance, infrastructure, information, and new markets. Lynda Saint-Nwafor, Chief Enterprise Business Officer, while speaking on the importance of utilising technology for increased business productivity, said: “At MTN Nigeria, we recognise that SMEs are the backbone of the Nigerian economy and are therefore committed to driving digital access, adoption and transformation across industries. “In celebration of women’s month, and as digital enablers for SMEs, this webinar curated specifically for female SMEs will enable them access information that will help them innovate and accelerate their digital transformation.” The webinar also featured an interactive Question & Answer session and panel discussion where women with expertise in scaling businesses addressed the attendees’ concerns. The panel included Lynda Saint-Nwafor, Chief Enterprise Business Officer at MTN Nigeria, Jane Egerton-Idehen, Tech Executive and Author, and Chioma Nwahiri, Head, Customer Engagement, Yello Digital Finance Services (YDFS). ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The telco giant remains committed to contributing to the development of SMEs through initiatives like webinars that tackle real-life challenges and proffer sustainable solutions.
