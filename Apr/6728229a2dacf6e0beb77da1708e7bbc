At least eight people were being treated for wounds, including two police officers. One officer and another of the wounded were in critical condition, Louisville Metro Police Department deputy chief Paul Humphrey said. The shooter was reported to have been “neutralised” by police, taking the death toll from the attack to five.

Officers exchanged gunfire with the shooter, who appeared to be a former employee of the bank, but it wasn’t clear how he died. Police had earlier warned people to stay away from the area. Witnesses who left the bank building told local TV station WHAS-TV that they heard gunfire inside the building.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “I was at the stoplight, and the first thing that I saw – there was a guy across the street at the intersection and he was lying down at the entrance to a hotel,” one eyewitness told WDRB, another local station.
