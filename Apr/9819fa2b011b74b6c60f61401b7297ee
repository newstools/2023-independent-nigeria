MINNA – The dust raised by the re­cent attempted attack on a water vendor, popular­ly called, ‘mai-ruwa’ in Hausa by some angry youths a fortnight ago has brought about palpable fears among residents of Minna, the state capital over the influx of persons suspected to have illegally migrated into Niger State from neighbouring countries. The youths who were appar­ently frustrated by the acute wa­ter scarcity due to the inability of the Niger State Water Board to provide water to the populace for almost a month, forcing residents to source for alternative means of meeting their domestic need for water overheard the water ven­dor, telling a woman that a truck of water containing ten jerricans is N1,000. The response angered the boys who hitherto were in groups dis­cussing the socio-economic hard­ship, coupled with the associated political uncertainties hence they charged towards the mai-ruwa demanding why he should sell the water he brought for between N150 and N200 from a borehole for such an exorbitant amount. It is also possible that the wa­ter vendors indiscriminately increase the cost based on how much they buy from the borehole and in order to meet up with how much returns they were expect­ed to make. These and more are some of the posers the relevant government offices should be able to streamline to build con­fidence between the parties con­cerned. Though the prompt interven­tion of some passersby saved what could have led to a full-blown fight between the youths who almost immediately started mobilising for a showdown, and successfully calmed them down, the ugly situation may resurface or re-enacted at some other lo­cations as long as almost all the mai-ruwas selling water within Minna metropolis and environs, in particular, believe that they have absolute powers to decide or indiscriminately increase the price of the water they fetch from boreholes or which they source from stagnant rivers and wells in farmlands, which they sell to unsuspecting citizens. Investigations by our corre­spondent indicate that the ma­jority of the water vendors are aliens, with a peculiar feature that makes them stand out from most Nigerian tribes speak Hau­sa as a general lingua franca to their customers and a strange language known only among themselves have the backing of some powerful men in the soci­ety who engage them to do water selling business for them to bring returns on a daily basis. But, while their employers or paymasters enjoy the good returns caused by the failure of the state government to provide potable water which is one of the most essential basic needs of the citizenry, the generality of Nigerians are considering the security implications of al­lowing foreigners without any proper documentations of their identities unfettered access to the nooks and crannies of the state, especially considering the fact that they understand and speak the common language while the indigenes do not understand theirs should they be having any sinister motive or planning any­thing evil against Nigerians or their host communities.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Only a fortnight ago, some Ni­geria Immigration Services (NIS) officers were said to have carried out a raid at a particular spot where the water vendors usually converge, and in the process ar­rested some of them while others ran into hiding, but surprisingly they were all released the follow­ing day after they were asked to write their names and was also made to pay N5 000 (five thousand Naira) each to buy their freedom. POLL This claim, the Public Rela­tions Officer (PRO) of the NIS Minna office, Mukhtar Abu could not confirm because he refused to pick up his calls when our corre­spondent tried to reach him for comments on what the agency is doing or may have done to check the influx of illegal aliens and if some arrests have been made. Although the state Commis­sioner for Water Resources and Dams Development, Mamman Musa promised to look into the possibilities of interfacing with the water vendors to avoid mis­understanding due to alleged exploitations with a view to reg­ulating their activities, the secu­rity loophole is still not bridged without the involvement of the NIS whose responsibility it is to control illegal migrants. A Minna resident, Mr. Ezra Yakoi, who operates a restaurant near where migrants usually con­verge had, apart from taking a swipe at the state government for failing in her responsibilities of providing water to the populace thereby encouraging the water vendors to invite more of their kinsmen to join them, expressed fears about the possible security implications of the situation. Two things bothering the likes of Yakoi are the high cost of wa­ter which is adding to their cost of running a business as it is be­coming increasingly difficult to sustain and the security implica­tions of the increasing number of water vendors with new faces emerging on a daily basis. Yakoi is right to have consid­ered the security implications of granting unfettered access into parts of the country and that is why it is very important for all three tiers of government to fashion out modalities to monitor strangers in both rural areas and cities. All efforts to get reactions from the state Commissioner for Inter­nal Security and Humanitarian Affairs, Mr. Emmanuel Umar proved abortive as his phone number kept indicating ‘unreach­able’. Also, a text message sent to him against possible hostilities between water vendors and their host communities or customers was not replied to at the time of filing this report.
