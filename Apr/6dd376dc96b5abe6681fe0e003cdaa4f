AWKA – The Commissioner of Police in Anambra state CP Echeng Echeng has tasked Christians nationwide and the good people of Anambra to emulate and adopt the selfless lifestyle of Christ as they join other Christians around the globe to celebrate Easter; the remembrance of the victorious death and resurrection of Jesus Christ as the price for the redemption of mankind. The CP equally sued for peaceful co-existence among Nigerians irrespective of their religious, political and socio-cultural leaning in consonance with the principles and teachings of Christ. The CP whose Easter message is contained in the press statement released by the Police Public Relations Officer of the Command, DSP Ikenga Tochukwu Anthony on Saturday, said the Police will intensify security to ensure a hitch-free Easter celebration in the state. Given the above, the Area Commanders, Heads of Tactical Units, and Divisional Police Officers (DOP’s) have intensified routine patrols and improved operational positioning to protect vulnerable points within their jurisdictions, including major highways, places of worship, residential areas, recreation centres, motor parks, financial institutions, Government/Private Infrastructures and all places of public resort. They are also directed to ensure that their officers and men conduct themselves professionally in line with extant laws and standard best practices before, during and after the festivity. Echeng said the command is also collaborating with other security agencies and stakeholders within the State to provide adequate security and safety in this regard. The CP while wishing Ndi-Anambra a happy, fruitful and hitch-free Easter Celebration, enjoins them to be security conscious and continue to provide the Police with useful information that will assist in effectively tracking down criminal elements in the society. He therefore encouraged the people to request any security services through the command control room number on 07039194332 or PPRO 08039334002 for a prompt response.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He also said that the ‘npf rescue me app’ is also available for free download on both Android and Apple IOS, for Android and iPhone users respectively.
