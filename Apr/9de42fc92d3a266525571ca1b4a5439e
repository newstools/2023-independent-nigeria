ABUJA  – Ahead of the No­vember 2023 gu­bernatorial elec­tion in Kogi State, a female aspirant, on the platform of the Labour Party (LP), Dr. Atule Ahma­du-Afolabi, has decried the rate of political intolerance and hostility to the women folk in the state. She, however, vowed not to be deterred by any of the antics, which male politicians were using to scare women away. Ahmadu-Afolabi made this known on Tuesday in Abuja at the Party’s Presidential Campaign Office, Wuse Zone 2, venue for governorship screening. She hinted that Kogi State has been characterised by so many political abnormalities, which only a determined and caring mother like her can change. According to her: “My decision, seeking to occupy the Lord Lugard House in Lokoja as next governor of the state was predicated on the urgent need to salvage the state from imminent collapse, due to maladmin­istration. “Apart from denying civ­il servants their legitimate wages by the present admin­istration, the state’s health­care system was in a deep mess. “Both human and natu­ral resources, which Kogi is endowed with, have not been properly harnessed and managed by successive gov­ernments in the state.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “I have the ability to tack­le political discrimination and other social vices that threaten security and dem­ocratic principles in the state. POLL “Going through the health institutions, some of them don’t have basic paracetamol. These are the things we are here to change. “My main focus is to en­sure that Kogi State is eco­nomically viable through selfless services. “If you are driving round the state now, you could see hunger physically on the faces of the people. That is why I am here to change the narrative for good”, she stressed.
