A House of Representatives member-elect, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, has filed for contempt of court against the Imo state Commissioner of Police. A High Court in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), which commences contempt proceedings against the Imo state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Mohammed Ahmed Barde, has okayed service of contempt proceedings on him for flouting court order. Recall that an Abuja High Court had earlier in the year granted an order restraining the Imo State Governor, the Nigerian Police, Inspector General of Police, Commissioner of Police Imo State, and the State Security Service from inviting, investigating, arresting or detaining the opposition coalition spokesperson, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere. However, in flagrant violation of the clear and mandatory order of the Court, the Commissioner of Police caused an illegal letter now quashed by the court to be issued inviting Ugochinyere for investigation. This was described as a desperate state government backed move to frame the Spokesman of Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) for murder, terrorism and arson. In a swift reaction to the action of the Police and to uphold the principles of the rule of law for which he has always stood firm, Ugochinyere applied to the Court to issue form 48 and 49, which are the forms for commencement of committal proceedings for contempt of Court. The Court while agreeing with Ugochinyere, ordered that the Forms against the Commissioner of Police, the Inspector General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba Alkali and the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Admin) Ukachi Opara be served on them through substituted means by delivering them to the Legal Department, or any officer or staff of the Nigeria Police Force at its headquarters Louis Edet House, Abuja.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ By this order of Court, the CP is expected to appear in court on 14th April 2023 to explain to the Court why he should not be sent to prison for three months for violating the orders of the Court.
