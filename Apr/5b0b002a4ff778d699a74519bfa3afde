REPORTING FROM WASHINGTON DC, USA  – The United States has become the first major fishing nation to ratify a deal to cut subsidies con­tributing to overfishing, the World Trade Organisa­tion (WTO) has said. The trade watchdog’s 164 members reached the deal, which aims to cut billions of dollars in harmful subsidies that are emptying the ocean of marine life, last year. Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, WTO’s Director-General on Twitter monitored by Dai­ly Independent wrote: “The United States has become the first major fishing nation to ratify a deal to cut subsidies contributing to overfishing “Hope others will follow suit. Let’s get it done by MC13!,” while specifically referring to the next major conference of the trade watchdog in 2024, where outstanding parts of the deal will be discussed. “We are proud to be among the first WTO members to ac­cept this agreement, which is the first ever multilateral trade agreement with envi­ronmental sustainability at its core,” U.S. Trade Represen­tative Katherine Tai said in an emailed statement. But it needs two-thirds of the members to sign on to take effect and only a hand­ful of smaller countries have accepted it so far. The United States ratified it on Tuesday. Recall that the global subsi­dies are estimated at $35.4 bil­lion, according to a 2019 study published in Marine Policy.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The top five subsidies are China, the European Union (EU), the United States, South Korea and Japan, it said, al­though not all of them are considered. POLL It would be recalled that Fishing Booker, on a recent quest to find out which are the best US fishing states, said: “We made use of our own data and paired that in­formation with other public fishing-related sources. This helped us better understand which states not only have the most prolific angling but also support and develop their fisheries.
