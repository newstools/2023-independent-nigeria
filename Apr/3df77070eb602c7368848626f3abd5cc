Minority shareholders in Union Homes Savings and Loans Plc, represented by the Independent Shareholders Association of Nigeria (ISAN) have lodged a petition with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria (FRCN), and Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) pleading intervention to prevent the imminent loss of their investments. As conveyed by the Petition titled, “Re: Disturbing Total Absence of Corporate Governance in Union Homes Savings & Loans and Consequential Rape of the Company”, the shareholders explained that Aso Savings & Loans Plc (ASO) was selected as the preferred bidder for the divestment and the parties entered into a “Transaction Implementation Agreement (The Agreement) together with Union Bank and UH Investment Nigeria Limited (UHNL), a special purpose vehicle set by ASO to facilitate the transaction”. According to the petitioners, the action of the leadership of Aso homes is tantamount to a considerable breach of corporate governance rules and asset stripping in its management of the company it acquired in 2013. They unanimously stated that significant breaches of clauses in the Agreement were committed by Aso Savings, and buttressed the allegation by citing clause 5.1.3.5 which provides that, “Satisfactory evidence that ASO has escrowed with a Nigeria Commercial Bank acceptable to UBN and CBN, the sum N5, 000,000,000 (Five Billion Naira) only being the fresh capital is to be injected into Union Homes Savings and Loans (UHSL) in consequence of the transaction outlined in the agreement. The petitioners also alleged that Aso Savings committed Fraud because, “Without acquiring the requisite Scheme Shares of UHSL, Aso homes, and its managers have continued to control the company and strip it of its assets and income. In particular, (both of ASO) have to account for over N12,000,000,000 of recoveries made from customers of UHSL over the last 10 years which is more than sufficient to recapitalise the bank. The petitioners also want ASO to account for the N1,600,000,000 recovered from UBN Plc in September 2021 and recovered N2,500,000,000 from the Lagos State Government in two tranches of one billion naira in December 2022 and N1.5 billion in January 2023. They also alleged that Aso Savings failed to observe strict corporate governance rules and engaged in corporate abuse due to its failure to perform provisions of the ‘Agreement’. It claimed that although ASO transferred some shares to UNHL to hold in trust, the transfer was illegal because ASO did not pay the consideration of N5 billion into an escrow account that would have ensured that Union Homes meets the minimum requirement for a National Mortgage Bank. They added that UHSL is, consequently, not on the CBN list of mortgage banks in Nigeria today.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
