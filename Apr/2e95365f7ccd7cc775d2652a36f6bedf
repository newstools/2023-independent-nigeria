ABUJA – Former Enugu State Governor Chimaroke Nnamani has berated the proponents of Interim National Government (ING), saying that it is treasonable, aberration and an affront to the sensibility of Nigerians. Senator Nnamani stated that ING is absurd and has no place in modern-day democratic rule, submitting that those behind the plot are enemies of Nigeria. He said: “The presidential election has been conducted and a winner has been declared. Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will be sworn in as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on May 29, 2023. ING is a needless distraction.” Nnamani who is the current Senator representing Enugu East in the Senate reiterated that “Asiwaju will be sworn in on May 29, 2023 and he will hit the ground running.” Nnamani believes that Tinubu will not deviate from his avowed commitment to the programmes of Social Protection, national transformation and restructuring. Nnamani, a contemporary of Tinubu as Governors in the 1999 set is optimistic that a Tinubu-led administration will address critical infrastructural development, youth unemployment and youth bulge, women empowerment as well as the challenges facing the girl-child. The former governor predicted that a Tinubu-led government will give priority to budget enhancements needed to address complex issues in the Health, Education, and Social Service sectors including portable drinking water and environmental sanitation.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He expressed optimism that the forthcoming administration will rejuvenate international recognitions and awareness that will attract other nations to invest in Nigeria and consequently, turn the nation’s economy around. POLL He therefore enjoined Nigerians across the divide to support the incoming administration which he hopes will be a government of national unity where no section of Nigeria will be marginalized or shortchanged in the scheme of things.
