Bayelsa State Governor Douye Diri has congratulated the Islamic faithful in the state and across Nigeria on the Eid-el-Fitri celebration. Diri, in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Daniel Alabrah, on Friday, said the end of the month-long fasting and the celebration of Eid-el-Fitri is a period to reflect on the lessons of sacrifice, tolerance and love that the feast epitomises. He noted that as one of the key pillars of Islam, fasting during Ramadan was important for developing the virtues of self-abnegation and tolerance in every Muslim. The governor said, “I urge them to continue to pray for the peace, progress and prosperity of Bayelsa State and Nigeria. “My administration will not detract from the ennobling principles of love, harmony and religious tolerance regardless of any resident’s legitimate belief or ethnicity. “We are committed to promoting peaceful co-existence between and among adherents of the different faiths in order to build a prosperous state for everyone to realise their dreams. “Again, I wish our Muslim brethren a happy Eid-el-Fitri celebration.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
