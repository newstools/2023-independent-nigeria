Bi-Courtney Aviation Services Limited (BASL), operator of the Murtala Muhammed Airport Ter­minal Two (MMA2), has assured air travellers pass­ing through its terminal of hitch-free movement as the nation celebrates the Eas­ter festivity. The terminal operators also felicitated the Christian faithful on this year’s Easter celebration, culminating in the Passover at the end of the 40-day lenten season. A statement by Mr. Oluwa­tosin Onalaja, Head of Corpo­rate Communications, BASL, expressed the hope that the benefits of the 40-day-long fast would be evident in strength­ened unity, compassion and love among all Nigerians. This he believed more es­pecially, as this year’s Easter period coincides with the holy month of Ramadan, when the Muslim faithful also engage in 30-day long fast and supplication. In identifying with the Christians on this special day however, Onalaja said BASL has upscaled its operational logistics to ensure a smooth and seamless experience for airline operators, travellers, vendors and other stakehold­ers at the MMA2 terminal throughout the festive period.
