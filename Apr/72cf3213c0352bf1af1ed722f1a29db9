The Independent Appeal board has dismissed the FA’s appeal to extend the bans given to Fulham’s Marco Silva and Aleksander Mitrovic, according to Sky Sports. Fulham just announced that the independent Appeal Board has dismissed the FA’s appeal of the two-game touchline ban and the eight-game for Alexander Mitrovic during the FA Cup game against Manchester United where it all kicked off. That has been thrown out by the Appeal Board. Marco Silva will now return for Fulham against Leeds United while Mitrovic will be eligible for selection for Fulham’s match on the 13th of May. In a short statement, the club said: “We are surprised that the FA decided to bring these appeals. However, we are pleased that the Appeal Board has now dismissed them in their entirety.”
