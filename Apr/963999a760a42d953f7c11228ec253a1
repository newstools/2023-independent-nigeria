Arsenal have offered Reiss Nelson a new contract as Aston Villa reportedly monitor the winger’s future. Doubts remain over Nelson’s future despite him being offered fresh terms to remain at the Emirates, with a host of Premier League clubs all vying for his signature. The Daily Mail claim that Villa, Fulham, West Ham and Brighton are among the teams interested in taking Nelson on a free transfer ahead of next season. AC Milan are also said to have expressed an interest, but Arsenal want to keep their academy graduate. The Premier League title-chasers have reportedly offered Nelson an increase on his current deal, which is believed to be worth in the region of £35,000-per-week. However, an agreement has not been reached which leaves his future at Arsenal uncertain, meaning he could leave the club for free at the end of this season. Nelson has only made five Premier League appearances this season, due to a thigh injury, but he has had a direct hand in five goals. He bagged two goals and an assist in the 5-0 win over Nottingham Forest back in October, before he came off the bench against Bournemouth to score a winning goal in dramatic fashion which downed the Cherries in the 97th minute. Nelson spent the duration of last season on loan at Eredivisie club Feyenoord where he made four assists and scored two goals in 21 total appearances. He also impressed during the Dutch club’s run to the Europa Conference League final, as he started each knockout game for Feyenoord, but lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho’s Roma. Villa boss Unai Emery worked with Nelson while he was at Arsenal, and he made four league appearances under the Spaniard after spending the 2018/19 season on loan at German side Hoffenheim.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
