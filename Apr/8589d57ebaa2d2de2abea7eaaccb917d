Arsenal are ready to launch a huge offer to snare Real Madrid midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni – much to Liverpool frustration. The France midfielder moved to the Bernabeu last summer from Monaco in a deal worth £70.4m (€80m). And the 23-year-old opted for a move to Los Blancos ahead of Liverpool, who had also pushed hard to sign the midfielder. Tchouamemi has made an excellent start to life with Real, featuring in 32 games in all competitions. However, he appears to have fallen down the pecking order in recent weeks with compatriot Eduardo Camavinga upsurping him in the side. And with Real Madrid ready to go all out for Jude Bellingham this summer, the prospect of Tchouameni leaving is emerging. Liverpool will certainly be an option to sign him if Real do decide to sell. However, reports in Spain claim it is Arsenal who are leading the charge. And the offer of Champions League football is almost certain to sway the deal their way.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Liverpool, by contrast, are facing a tough task in securing a top-four finish. And with potentially only Europa League football on offer, the Reds will likely miss out on signing the Frenchman. POLL Per the report, Arsenal will offer Real their money back for the star in order to seal the deal.
