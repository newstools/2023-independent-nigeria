Newcastle are considering a move for Barcelona winger Raphinha this summer, according to Mundo Deportivo. When the Brazilian played for Leeds, the Magpies tried to sign him before he joined Barcelona. Newcastle are in the race to qualify for next season’s Champions League, a competition they have not been in since 2002, and the club’s owners are ready to spend to strengthen their squad with three or four new additions. Raphinha signed for Barça last year for €57m plus €8m in variables and has a contract until 2027. He is a player who is in Xavi’s plans, however, his recent outbursts when substituted have worked against him, to the point of annoying a section of the dressing room. The Brazil international prefers to operate on the right, a position where Xavi likes to deploy Ousmane Dembélé. Barça urgently need to reduce their wage bill and, according to the internal calculations made by the club’s board, they need to make €100m from transfers. Raphinha is not a priority sale but the club knows he has suitors, especially in the Premier League.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ (SOURCE: Get Football News Spain)
