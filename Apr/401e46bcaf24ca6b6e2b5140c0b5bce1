The Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) in collaboration with Zeenab Foods Limited has commissioned the first Nigerian Export Trade House in Changsha, the capital of Hunan province, China. I Mr Victor Ayemere, Chairman of Zeenab foods Limited, in chats with Daily Independent, said that the trade house, which was recently commissioned, is geared towards the expansion of Nigeria’s non-oil exports for sustainable growth. The initiative, according to Ayemere, will make Nigeria’s non-oil products visible in the global market. “It will serve as a viable means for economic growth, poverty alleviation, industrial development, employment opportunities and also help to boost foreign exchange earnings,” he said. He commented the Federal Government for entrusting the company with the mandate to set up and operate the Trade House in China. He urged prospective exporters to leverage on this opportunity to export their non-oil products as the risk inherent in export would be eliminated. Mr Ezra Yakusak, Chief Executive Officer of NEPC, said the trade house would serve as a hub for exporters to export their commodities seamlessly. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The commissioning had in attendance high-ranking officials of the government and business communities of both Nigeria and China.
