Former Governor of Enugu State, Senator Chimaroke Nnamani, has described the petition filed by the Presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, against the President-elect Bola Ahmed Tinubu as dead on arrival. He advised Obi to withdraw his petition and join the President-elect in making a new nation. Obi who came third in the election had filed his petition to challenge the outcome of the poll at the Presidential Election Petition Court in Abuja where he alleged that the February 25 election that brought in Tinubu was characterised by various irregularities including the non-qualification of Tinubu and his running mate, Senator Kashim Shettima to contest the election. Senator Nnamani, in a statement on Sunday, urged Obi and his supporters to align with the ebullience and conviviality of welcoming Tinubu’s victory to the Office of the President of the greatest black nation on earth. However, he said Obi knows he has neither the spread nor national appeal to win the Presidential election pointing out that what Obi is doing with the petition is “bad belle, petulance and demarketing. ”“His Petition is dead on arrival. He does not have the spread or national appeal. His appeal to non-electoral matters is to demarket the President-elect and besmirch his reputation.”His petition is ego-driven, a joke carried too far. His attempt to highlight non-electoral issues is trying to embarrass the President-elect, “Obi needs to come down from his high horse to allow sedate minds to negotiate on behalf of the Igbo and South East for a safe landing to include our stake in the national Palavar and Share of the accruals of the commonwealth.“We must join the mainstream and participate in making a new Nigeria. “We are not going anywhere. We de kampe and ready to bargain for our own share. It is common knowledge that others are doing the same.“Igbo has to confront reality now or be consigned to the backwoods of history. Time to align is now,” he said.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
