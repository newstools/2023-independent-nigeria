Experts are optimistic about the in­coming administration of Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s economic plan but they fear rising inflation may impede his strategy to reinvigorate the economy. In separate interviews, economic ex­perts, who spoke to Daily Independent at the weekend, said their optimism about the incoming government may be wan­ing as the May 29, 2023 inauguration draws near. These analysts also stressed that chal­lenging issues in 2023 like rising inflation, the fuel subsidy resolu­tion, public debt overhang, low investment inflows and declining capital importation should be ad­dressed headlong by the incoming administration. They said in order to address the concerns of the youth, Tinubu will need to turn his immediate attention to the economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had projected that Nigeria’s economy would de­cline from 3.2 percent in 2023 to 3.0 percent in 2024, indicating a 0.2 percent drop. Painting an unpleasant pic­ture, Stephen Iloba, a Lagos-based economist, said, “With food infla­tion, at a seventeen-year high and up 28 percent year-on-year from 2021 to 2022, official youth unemployment hit 42.5 percent (according to the National Bureau of Statistics) and oil production has fallen to a forty-year low. “Power is still expensive— Nigeria is home to sixty million diesel generators and fuel prod­ucts are still imported—and the World Bank estimates that over 40 percent of Nigerians live be­low the poverty line. Borrowing on international markets to invest in infrastructure is not really an option for the new Tinubu admin­istration, as Nigerian debt has nearly doubled since 2015 and is now over one hundred billion dollars”.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Rising Inflation POLL The National Bureau of Sta­tistics (NBS) while releasing the March 2023 inflation figures said inflation rose from 21.91 percent in February to 22.04 percent. The March increase comes across as the third consecutive surge in the country’s inflation figure since the year began. According to the NBS report, “The March 2023 inflation rate showed an increase of 0.13 per­cent points when compared to February 2023 headline inflation rate. “On a year-on-year basis, the headline inflation rate was 6.13 percent points higher compared to the rate recorded in March 2022 which was 15.92 percent,” the data bureau said. This shows that the headline inflation rate (year-on-year basis) increased in March 2023 when compared to the same month in the preceding year (March 2022). “However, on a month-on-month basis, the all-items index in March 2023 was 1.86 percent, which was 0.15 percent points higher than the rate recorded in February 2023 (1.71 percent),” NBS said. According to the report, this means that in March 2023, on average, the general price level was 0.15 percent higher relative to February 2023. NBS also said items like food and non-alcoholic beverages contributed largely on the divi­sional level to the increase in the headline. “The contributions of items on the divisional level to the in­crease in the headline index are food and non-alcoholic beverag­es (11.42 percent); housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuel (3.69 percent),” the agency said. “Clothing and footwear (1.69 percent); transport (1.43 percent); furnishings, household equip­ment and maintenance (1.11 per­cent); education (0.87 percent); health (0.66 percent); miscella­neous goods and services (0.37 percent); restaurant and hotels (0.27 percent); alcoholic beverage, tobacco and kola (0.24 percent); recreation and culture (0.15 per­cent) and communication (0.15 percent).” In January 2023, headline in­flation rate was 21.82%. Looking at the trend, the February 2023 in­flation rate showed an increase of 0.09% points when compared to January 2023 headline inflation rate. Worrisome Debt Profile By the third quarter of 2022, Nigeria’s public debt stock which includes external and domestic debt, according to the NBS rose from N42.84 trillion or $103.31 bil­lion in the second quarter of 2022 to N44.06 trillion or $101.91 billion. The NBS said the figure shows that the public debt in national currency grew by 2.84 percent within the period. The data showed the debt fig­ure comprised the debt stock of the Federal Government, the 36 state governments and the Feder­al Capital Territory (FCT). However, the statistical office said the share of external debt to total public debt stood at 38.91 percent in Q3 2022, while domestic debt was recorded at 61.08 percent. In their own opinion, the Ni­geria Employers Consultative Association (NECA) raised the alarm that Nigeria’s debt profile could hit N77 trillion by June 2023, saying returning the economy to the path of sustainable growth de­mands that certain fundamentals must be gotten right. In his reaction, Oyeyemi Kale, KPMG Nigeria’s chief economist and former Statistician-General of the Federation, warned that policy measures aimed at con­trolling spending may not be the best strategy for moderating inflation. He said the economic dis­tortion witnessed following the CBN’s naira redesign policy which caused a cash crunch in the econo­my since January 2023 despite the expectation of it stimulating slow­down in demand-pull inflation was a pointer to possible hurdle for the incoming government. He said, “It was expected that the scarcity of redesigned notes would stimulate a slowdown in demand-pull inflation, especially given the series of interest rate hikes from the central bank (500 basis points since May 2022). This has, however, not happened yet,” he said. “This might indicate a drop in output below effective de­mand, despite the cash crunch, with some producers of goods and services whose activities are cash-based facing challenges purchasing inputs for production or replacing their stock and dis­tributing them across the country. This is a red flag for the economy, going forward”. Cyril Ampka, an Abuja-based economist, said, “The expected growth being yearned for by Nige­rians may be dampened, more so, with the persisting infrastructur­al deficit in support of production across sectors and coupled with high inflation and a volatile debt burden”.
