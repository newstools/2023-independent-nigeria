In Myanmar, more than 3,000 civilians have been killed over the past two years, amid the popular uprising against the military regime that came to power in a coup. The army has targeted civilians with airstrikes and is accused of carrying out mass killings. And nearly half of all the deaths have occurred in one single state: Sagaing. For our second disturbing report on Myanmar, our foreign affairs correspondent Secunder Kermani and filmmaker Katie Arnold have been investigating the abuses, including the actions of one notorious army unit. And a very strong warning, their report contains very distressing images and harrowing descriptions of extreme violence. (SOURCE: Channel 4)
