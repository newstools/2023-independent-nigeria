LAGOS  –  Professional Footballers Associ­ation of Nigeria (PFAN) has dis­tanced itself from the purported plans of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to set up a new players union, reportedly hinged on the outcome of the meeting of the Reconciliation Committee led by the Deputy Governor Of Edo State, His Excellency Phillip Shuaibu. In a reaction to what has been described as a ploy to fur­ther deepen the induced crisis that led to the break away from ANPFU, the PFAN Task Force has condemned the latest move to set up a new players union as a misnomer and miscalculated attempts by the NFF to further strengthen its strangle-like hold on Nigeria football. According to Chief Rumson Baribote, the meeting held at the Sunday Dankaro House was at the instance of the NFF and presided over by NFF President Ibrahim Gusau, also had in attendance was the Deputy Governor of Edo State, His Excellency Phillip Shuaibu and Dr. Mohammed Sanusi, as well as, PFAN task force members that included Dahiru Sadi, Edema Fuludu, Austin Popo and Chief Rumson Victor Baribote. Baribote stated that the meet­ing was supposed to be a contin­uation of an ongoing Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Initi­ated by the Mohammed Kurfi led States Football Association Chairmen on the disputed Sep­tember 30 NFF election which is pending in the Court of Appeal Abuja Division. “That the PFAN Task Force was looking forward to an inde­pendent committee to address urgent reforms, imbalance, eq­uity and fair representation in the composition of the NFF Con­gress, its Board and sub-commit­tees in consonance with decisions reached at the meeting of Decem­ber 6 and previous meetings. He continued, “the players union have no issues for recon­ciliation, and if even there are such issues it is not within the purview of the NFF to set up a committee to address such issues. Such issues if any, are internal matters of the players union as an independent organisation and does not require any external in­fluence.” Obviously miffed by the purported plans to form a new players union, beginning with a constitution drafting committee, Baribote rubbished the plans, stating that, “PFAN has a consti­tution, so what other constitution are we talking about here? I’m confused.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
