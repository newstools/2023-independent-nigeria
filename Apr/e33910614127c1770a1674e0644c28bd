Adegboyega Oyetola, the im­mediate past Osun State gov­ernor, on Monday, condoled with The Nations Newspa­per Managing Editor (ME) in-charge of Northern Op­erations, Alhaji Yusuf Alli, over the death of his mother, Hajiya Hawau Yusuf. The late Hajiya Hawau died on Sunday at the age of 89 in Ilorin, Kwara State. The former governor de­scribed the death of the late Hawau as a great loss to the entire family in particular, the Muslim community in Kwara State and Nigeria in general. Oyetola, in a statement by his media aide, Ismail Omip­idan, described the late Ha­jiya Hawau as a devout Mus­lim and an entrepreneur who devoted her life to productive ventures and showed her chil­dren the path to success. “I received with great shock the passing of your mother, the late Hajiya Ha­wau Yusuf, who died yester­day. Although she was aged but the death of a beloved one is usually devastating no mat­ter how old the person may be. “Her death is no doubt a heavy loss to the family and the entire Muslim communi­ty. But we should be consoled by the fact that Mama lived an exemplary life worthy of emulation. “Allah will comfort you, your siblings and other mem­bers of the family in particu­lar and the Muslim communi­ty in Kwara State and Nigeria general.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
