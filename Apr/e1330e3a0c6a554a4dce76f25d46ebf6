LAGOS – The Maritime Workers’ Union of Nigeria (MWUN) led by Comrade (Prince) Adewale Adeyanju has commended the Director – General of the Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Bashir Jamoh over the two utility vehicles donated to the union. The vehicles include  one Toyota Hiace 18 seater bus and Toyota Hilux. The vehicles were presented to the Union at the Agency’s(NIMASA) office. The occasion  witnessed  an impressive handing over ceremony as the vehicles were handed over  to the President – General of the union, Comrade Adeyanju, on Tuesday March 28, 2023 at Apapa, Lagos,   with some of his executives in attendance. This gesture by NIMASA under the visionary leadership of Dr. Jamoh, according to the Union  will not only strengthen the Agency  and the union’s relationship but will further promote industrial growth, harmony, and development in the sector. Indeed, Dr. Jamoh has pragmatically extended the Agency’s outreach on social corporate responsibility (CSR) to the union. It’s of note that this very rare giant stride taken by NIMASA has demonstrated its act of responsiveness and commitment towards extending  Corporate Social Responsibility to stakeholders in the maritime sector. This  gesture has invariably put Dr. Jamoh’s NIMASA in the front burner of the union’s leadership heart and to the delight of the generality of the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria. The Union will continued to positively partner NIMASA in the sector believing same that this gesture will enhance the operational network of the union and its members at all times. However, while the union is fervently praying that the Almighty God keeps the NIMASA henchman in his good health enmeshed in longevity, may his dynamic qualities of leadership see him through all the tenures of his office.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
