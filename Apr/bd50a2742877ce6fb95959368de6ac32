The safety and welfare of factory workers in Anambra State was the crux of discourse at the state assembly as the Factory Workers’ Safety Bill scaled through second reading. Deputy Speaker of the House Rt. Hon. Dr. Paschal Arinzechukwu Agbodike, who sponsored the factory workers’ safety bill, said the bill when enacted as law, will help a great deal to compel employers of labuor to see the safety and health of their employees as a topmost priority rather than treat such with levity and complacency. According to Agbodike, the bill is designed to ensure the safety and protection of factory workers in the state from occupational and production hazards by providing co-relating duties and penalties for the breach thereof. Agbodike equally stated that the bill mandates every employer to carry out an appropriate risk assessment in relation to the safety and health of persons employed and, on the basis of these results, adopt preventive and protective measures to ensure that under all conditions of their intended use, all chemicals, machinery, equipment, tools and processes under the control of the employer are safe for the work environment. He also explained that the bill when passed into law will prevent employers from using their employees as robots and machines coupled with compelling them to work overtime and extra hours without recourse to their health conditions as well as pay commensurate with their duties. Agbodike who also represents Ihiala 2 state constituency noted that the factory workers safety bill is intended to create and guarantee favourable work environment for all those involved in the production process. The bill which was first read in 2019 has passed through second reading on the floor of the House and is expected to receive the endorsements of other lawmakers for the third and final reading for onward passage into law.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
