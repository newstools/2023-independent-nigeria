LAGOS  – Africa needs a significant inflow of infrastructure investment and funds to achieve its energy goal, the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) said. Akinwumi Adesina, President of AfDB, who disclosed this at the 2023 Nigeria International Energy Summit (NIES) in Abuja from April 16-20 with the theme “global perspectives for a sustainable energy future”, lamented that Africa’s energy sector is poor. He said despite the crucial need for energy security, access to finance for developing countries was increasingly being made contingent on net zero commitment. According to him, Africa’s energy transition will need $100 billion annually in investments between 2020 and 2040. He added: “Lack of energy security poses an existential threat to human security. Consequently, many countries are prioritizing energy security even as increased fossil fuel use impairs climate action; with their energy security plans centred on gas as a transition fuel” He lamented that many Asian countries have prioritized energy security by increasing purchases above price caps and in non-dollar-denominated contracts while Germany and the UK have turned back to coal for power generation. He maintained that the continent was well positioned to achieve the net zero targets through a combination of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, green hydrogen etc and the pragmatic utilization of gas as a transition fuel. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He added: “To guarantee food and energy security, Africa must build a domestic economy resilient to global and regional shocks which have increased in intensity and frequency. To meet SDG7, African countries need to connect 90 million people annually to electricity over the next eight years and move 130 million people to use clean cooking fuels”.
