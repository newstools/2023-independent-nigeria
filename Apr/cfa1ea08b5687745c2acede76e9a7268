The Ogun State Muslim Pil­grims Welfare Board has extend­ed the payment of out standing hajj fare balance to Wednesday, April 26, 2023, so as to avail the intending pilgrims the oppor­tunity to complete their actual payment of N2, 999,000. Executive secretary of the board, Alhaji Salau Dauda, made this known while speak­ing with newsmen in his of­fice at Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. Dauda said intending pil­grims were mandated to bal­ance up on or before the date as late payments would not be entertained. The executive secretary noted that the extension was necessary to accommodate those who were yet to balance their outstanding payments, adding that the Eid-el-Fitri holiday was one of the rea­sons for the extension. He stated that a medical test for intending pilgrims to ascertain their health status before embarking on the jour­ney was ongoing, enjoining those who had not done the test to show up on Wednesday, April 26, 2023. Dauda advised those who were yet to submit their in­ternational passports to do so immediately in order to com­mence necessary documenta­tion and processing of their visas with Saudi Arabian au­thority, urging them to contact the board’s secretariat com­plex for further clarifications.
