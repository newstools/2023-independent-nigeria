LAGOS – The Lagos State Office of Civic Engagement has announced the soft launch of the Upgraded Citizens’ Gate 2.0, a citizens’ engagement platform, which is aimed at bringing governance closer to the people. Special Adviser to the Governor on Civic Engagement, Aderemi Adebowale, in her remark at a press conference held in Alausa, Ikeja, on Thursday, said the Citizens’ Gate 2.0 platform, which is a one-stop shop, is a conscious effort to establish, deepen and sustain an all-inclusive mode of engagement and communication with various stakeholders in the state. Adebowale said it is also to strength interaction between the people and the government while participating in dialogue. She noted that the implementation of the more robust platform in all Ministries, Agencies and Departments (MDAs) in the state was a crucial step towards promoting a more interactive, transparent, accountable and citizens’ engagement in government. Adebowale noted that it was expected that over time, active and ongoing usage of the Citizens’ Gate 2.0, handled by resolvers from various MDAs, would make it easier for citizens to participate in dialogue and decision-making processes alongside the state government. The special Adviser commended the Lagos State government for blazing the trail in bringing governance to the people via mobile phones and the Internet through the deployment of the more robust platform, a web and app-based e-governance channel that enables access to and delivery of public goods. Also at the event, Commissioner for Science and Technology, Hakeem Fahm, said that through the platform, the state would continue to leverage technology to bring governance closer to the people, enhance feedback mechanism, transparency and real-time interface, even as he commended the office for getting the citizens involved.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Similarly, the Commissioner for Information, Gbenga Omotoso, and Special Adviser to the Governor on Work and Infrastructure, Aramide Adeyoye, said the platform is a useful tool to ensure participatory governance while keeping Lagosians involved in a scientific way.
