LAGOS – The Lagos State government has intervened in bringing sustainable solutions to the egg glut confronting poultry farmers in the state. The state through the Ministry of Agriculture has facilitated the offtake of minimum of 300,000 eggs from the Erikorodo Poultry Estate in Ikorodu by a private firm – Farm Alert Limited. After weeks of visits and negotiations by the state’s Commissioner for Agriculture, Abisola Olusanya and other senior ministry officials towards ensuring that all parties are in agreement to modalities of the offtake, the operations commenced on Monday. She said that the support from the State Government shall further enhance the development of the poultry value chain in Lagos. Olusanya stated that the Sanwo-Olu’s administration will continue to put measures in place to create a conducive environment for farmers to operate in line with efforts to ensure sufficiency in food production in the State. She added that Governor Sanwo-Olu has championed the food systems transformation plan with the overall objective of improving the livelihood of the agricultural value chain actors towards wealth creation, job security, increased inclusiveness in sectoral policy formulation with a view to the production and supply of wholesome nutritious foods to Lagosians. However, the poultry farmers operating within Erikorodo and Aiyedoto poultry estates form a large percentage of registered farmers under the Poultry Association of Nigeria (PAN) – Lagos State Chapter, and the move enhances the food security agenda of the State Government.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The Estates’ poultry farmers stated that the recent egg glut issue was aggravated by the cash crunch, closure of schools, amongst other factors.
