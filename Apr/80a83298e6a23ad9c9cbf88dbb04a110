Manchester City are plotting to sign Barcelona star Ansu Fati this summer, according to a report. The Spain winger is reportedly one of the players Barca are willing to offload in the wake of financial difficulties. They need to raise €200m to meet with FFP regulations and amid sanction from La Liga. That has seen their chances of adding new signings put on ice and has also resulted in Gavi’s contract being downgraded making him a youth team player again instead. Now Fati, previously a target for Manchester United, is on Manchester City’s radar. Per Football Insider, Pep Guardiola is plotting to bring the Etihad this summer. And the chances of a move to Manchester City have been raised following recent events. That’s after the 20-year-old’s father admitted his anger at his son’s lack of minutes this season under Xavi. Barca brought in Raphinha in a £58m deal from Leeds last summer. And the Brazilian is now one of the first names on the teamsheet, much to Fati snr’s frustration.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “If it was up to me, I would take him [to another team]. As a dad, I am angry. Seeing Ansu play so little winds you up a little bit. And sometimes I think as a father, not a coach,” said his father. POLL And while Fati himself would prefer to fight for his place at Barcelona, the matter looks set to be taken out his hands. He has been on the club’s books since the age of 10. But a big-money deal, reportedly in the region of £45m, will convince them to sell.
