YENAGOA  – Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, the Deputy Governor of Bayelsa State, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, has called on media practitioners in the country to pay more attention to critical issues affecting Nigeria and shun compromise in their re­portage. Ewhrudjakpo made the call when he received a del­egation of the state chapter of the Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ) led by the chairperson, Grace Orunimieghe, in Government House, Yenagoa, on Thursday. This was contained in a statement issued by his Se­nior Special Assistant on Media. Ewhrudjakpo said that while the media plays the statutory role of informing, educating and entertaining society, it should also be in the vanguard of moulding society through investigative journalism and its agenda-set­ting role. The deputy governor ob­served that the information space was being inundated with compromised informa­tion and the social media was fast pushing the conventional media away from its respon­sibility. While describing NAWOJ as a formidable association, he lamented that the media had been awash with a lot of issues that were diversionary as re­gards the just-concluded gen­eral elections in the country. He particularly tasked journalists to do more in the area of investigative journal­ism to expose societal ills as well as nurture the young ones in the profession.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
