Arsenal and West Ham United have both joined the race for Villarreal Samuel Chukwueze, according to reports today. Claims from the Spanish media, relayed by Estádio Deportivo, say there’s a big race for the 23-year-old this summer. The winger has 13 goals and 11 assists for Villarreal this season, and that’s why Arsenal and West Ham have taken more of an interest in taking him to England. The La Liga side had already been thinking of making a big sale with him. The problem is that his contract expires in 2024, and since there’s no agreement for a renewal, then his market value is dropping down a little.So even though Chukwueze is protected by a €80m release clause, it’s said that his price should be of around €40m. That’s still a decent chunk of money for a player whose value on Transfermarkt stands at €20m. What Arsenal and West Ham should be aware of is that they should still find more competition in the Premier League, because the Spanish media claims the likes of Aston Villa, Everton and Newcastle United are all interested in the winger as well.
