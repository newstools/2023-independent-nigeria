Following the destruction of properties worth millions of naira by a caterpillar accompanied by armed military men on Friday, 10th of June 2022 at The De Executive Suites located along Queen Elizabeth road Ibadan, a business mogul and traditional leader, HRH Olatunde Oginni (JP) has approached court demanding for justice over the illegal demolition. According to a charge sheet made available to newsmen in Ibadan on Wednesday, Trent Law Firm on behalf of HRH Olatunde Oginni has instituted a suit at the High Court of Oyo State of Nigeria in the Ibadan Judiciary Division Holden at Ibadan in the matter of an application for the enforcement of fundamental rights. The respondents in the suit are the Attorney General of the Federation, the Minister of Defense, the Nigerian Army, the Chief of Army Staff, The General Officer Commanding (GOC) 2nd Mechanised Division of the Nigerian Army, Adekunle Fajuyi Cantonment, Ibadan Oyo State, and Major Bamire, the Commander, Operation Burst, Oyo State. It will be recalled that a petition had earlier been written by the management of De Executive Suites to many important offices which includes the 2 Division of the Nigerian Army, Adekunle Fajuyi Cantonment, Ibadan, office of the Chief of Army Staff, Nigerian army Headquarters Abuja, Office of the Chairman Senate Security Committee, Abuja, and many other relevant authorities without getting a positive response. According to the statement signed by Oba Oginni and made available to newsmen in Ibadan demanded why the Nigerian Army authority is yet to take a decision after formally receiving a complaint against Major Banire, the Commander of Oyo State Operation Burst who led his men to destroy the properties via the petition. “This is a case of gross misuse of power by some people in positions of authority, and a gross violation of our fundamental human right, by coming to destroy multi-millions naira worth properties without any court order or valid court judgment from the military that accompanied the caterpillar for destruction”.
