Former governor of Oyo State, Senator Rashidi Adewolu Ladoja has congratulated fellow Muslims for successfully witnessing the end of this year’s Ramadan fasting period, a period that came with tough spiritual challenges that were designed to strengthen our Iman and Tawheed. Senator Ladoja said during this period of self-discipline, we had seen the importance of abstention from all sinful acts that are in the overall interest of our spiritual life and happiness. God teaches us to eschew evils because it’s for our ultimate good. One of the greatest blessings of Ramadan is that it helps us to get closer to our Creator, strengthen our faith, and promote charity or the spirit of giving to the weak and poor. It is important that we continue to live with the spirit of love, peace and harmony that Ramadan requires. It is equally important that we remember our states and country as we pray at our respective Eid prayer grounds. We must pray for God to enlarge His mercies and blessings upon the country.
