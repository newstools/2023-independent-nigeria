The benefits of Group life insurance for employees, family, or groups need not be over-emphasised as they say, the taste of a puddy is in the eating. For deceased families of SUBEB employees, it was unbelievable that insurance can come to their financial rescue in time of need. Recently, Lasaco Assurance Plc presented over N190 million death benefits to families of 97 deceased staff of both Lagos State Universal Basic Education and Local Government and Community Affairs. In the public presentation chaired by Mr. Kayode Robert, the Special Assistant to the Lagos State Governor on Local Government and Community Affairs, appreciated Lasaco for consistency in handling the Group Life Scheme over the years. The Managing Director of Lasaco Assurance, Mr Razzaq Abiodun, traced the genesis of the group life scheme for the civil and public servants in Lagos State to the administration of former Lagos State Governor who is now the president-elect of Nigeria. He confirmed that Lasaco had paid almost N3 billion as death benefits to the beneficiaries of 1,356 deceased staff since 2017, that they began public presentation of death benefits on the particular scheme. Abiodun, used the opportunity to praise the state government for prompt payment of premiums, noting that there were few state governments committed to insurance on a consistency basis. He also admonished beneficiaries to arrange personal insurance policies beyond the ones provided by the employers of labour since they have now seen the benefit of insurance.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
