Stars Builders Academy left back, Onyedikachi Ohanedo is delighted to be back in the camp of Nigeria’s U-20 men’s national team to fight for a place in the Coach Ladan Bosso’s squad, as the team begins prepa­ration ahead of the FIFA U-20 World Cup billed for next month in Argentina. Onyedikachi was part of the invited players to the Flying Eagles camp in the lead up to the U-20 AFCON champi­onship hosted by Egypt in March, but failed to make the final cut but did enought to get called back to fight for a seat on the plane to Argentina. The enterprising de­fender said missing out of the Egypt party has served as a motivating factor for him to work harder and stake a claim, by exerting himself with a commanding presence and take advantage of the opportunity he has been giving to prove his mettle once again. With just few days of training expedition in the camp of the Flying Eagles, it appears Ohane­do is already winning the heart of coaches, fellow teammates and specta­tors alike with his dash­ing speed, his ability to assist against the run of play, and accurate ball distribution. Reacting further to his call up ahead of the FIFA U-20 men’s world cup next month in Argentina, the dashing left back has vowed to show hundred percent commitment and hopes that his dedication will be the yardstick that will speak volume of his work rate which will earn him a place in coach Ladan Bosso’s squad. “I’m excited about this invitation and I feel bet­ter, I know I will give it my all, and with God on my side it will end in tes­timony”
