Barcelona’s pursuit of Lionel Messi has dominated the headlines in recent weeks, with the club determined to bring their prodigal son back to Camp Nou ahead of the coming season. Although the operation will be difficult, Barça are open to various economic solutions in their bid to re-sign the Argentine. One of them could include Barcelona selling their remaining 24% stake in Barça Studios. Nevertheless, as per Gerard Romero, Messi alone is not the priority for Barça in the coming summer, with the club targeting at least three more signings apart from the Argentine. The Blaugrana are already understood to have sealed the signing of Inigo Martinez, with the defender reportedly having already signed a two-year contract. Barça are also leading the chase to sign Manchester City captain and midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, whose contract at Etihad expires at the end of the season. Romero’s claims are hardly surprising as Barcelona have appeared quite keen on strengthening other areas of the pitch, including the right-back unit. They have been linked with moves for Juan Foyth, Thomas Meunier, and Diogo Dalot, among many others. Even Reece James has reportedly emerged as an option for the Catalans, who are also in the market for a new forward.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Vitor Roque is undoubtedly the top target for Barça for the centre-forward position, given the Brazilian’s age and potential to become one of the best in the world. POLL Although the operation is going to be tricky, especially amid competition from Premier League rivals, Barcelona are more than up for the challenge. As we approach the final phase of the campaign, things lot could get clearer in the coming weeks, as far as Barcelona’s transfer activity is concerned.
