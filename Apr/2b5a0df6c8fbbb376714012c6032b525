LAGOS – The drive of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Ogun State Secretariat to acquire working tools for effective service delivery is yielding results as New Horizons, an ICT firm responded to the Secretariat’s appeal by donating a brand new Lenovo Laptop and a Printer. Mr. Shina Oyerinde who represented the company said the Scheme has been a very worthy partner to his organisation and the donation is just a token of appreciation as more donations are on their way from his company, saying the company will not hesitate to accommodate the Secretariat in her Corporate Social Responsibility Project. Oyerinde used the opportunity to propose ICT training for all staff and their children at a highly subsidized rate. While receiving the items, the NYSC Ogun State Coordinator, Mrs. Shokpeka Winified Ngozi appreciated New Horizon for the donation and promised to deepen the synergy between both organisations. In attendance during the presentation were heads of branches and units.
