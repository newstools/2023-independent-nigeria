KANO  – A Kano State High Court has granted leave for a process that would compel the Kano State Attorney-General and Commis­sioner for Justice, Musa Abdul­lahi Lawan, to immediately file charges against Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, Alhassan Ado Doguwa, and oth­ers for alleged conspiracy over culpable homicide. The High Court, presided over by Justice Maryam Sabo Mni, granted a Kano retired Chief Magistrate, Muntari Gar­ba Dandago, to apply for order of mandamus to compel Kano number one judicial officer to execute his functions. In her ruling, Justice Sabo Mni upheld that “leave is hereby granted to the applicant to apply for the issuance of an order of mandamus against the respon­dent, that is Attorney-General of Kano State, compelling him to exercise his power under section 211 of the constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) to immediately file a charge against Alhassan Ado Doguwa and his conspira­tors for the offences of criminal conspiracy, culpable homicide, mischief, incitement of public disturbance and possession of fire arms before a court of com­petent jurisdiction”. Order of mandamus is a ju­dicial writ issued as a command to an inferior court or ordering a person to perform a public or statutory duty. The court ruling came on the heels of an ex parte application by counsel to the applicant, Y.I Shariff. The motion ex parte which contained 19 paragraphs of affi­davit was duly sworn to by the applicant himself, dated April 5, 2023, and the written address filed by the applicant’s counsel, dated April 10, 2023. The court subsequently adjourned the case to May 12, 2023, for hearing of motion on notice.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Reacting to the development, the Kano State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Musa Abdullahi Lawan, said, “Kano State Ministry for Justice is still waiting for Nigeria Police to complete their investigation and bring back the case file.” POLL The Kano number one law officer disclosed that “the police have written to the ministry of­ficially that the IGP has taken over investigation and already assigned a special team headed by an AIG from the headquarters to conduct the investigation over the incident.”
