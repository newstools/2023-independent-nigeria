Prof Anthony Ujene has vowed to develop synergy with relevant stakeholders at the University of Uyo to leverage on potentials that abound at the institute’s Faculty of Environmental Studies in or­der to enhance the ranking of the university. The professor of Construc­tion Management, who has been an academic staff at the university since 2001, made the commitment in a chat with Dai­ly Independent shortly after he was elected Dean of the Faculty of Environmental Studies. Making reference to strength flourishing in the faculty, Ujene had stated in his manifesto that “about 12 recognised scholars” in the faculty have been contrib­uting to the ranking of the uni­versity and that the effort “can be improved through collaboration and cooperation.” Reiterating his five-point agenda under the acronym of “WAVES”, the building expert identified “youthfulness, vibran­cy, experience and competence” as unique values, which he said has created advantage for him to serve at various capacities in the university, he stressed the need to “make waves … and move to the next level.” The WAVE mantra encom­passes “welfare and well-being”, “accountability and accessibil­ity”, “visibility and visionary leadership”, “equity and effec­tiveness”; and “selflessness and synergy.” With emphasis to use the Fac­ulty of Environmental Studies as springboard to adding impetus to the university of Uyo, he had em­phasized in his agenda thus: “We will strive to make this faculty more visible within the universi­ty by building close relationship with the top management, using various organs and strategic lob­bying marked by foresight, imag­inations and critical thinking to ensure that we are more involved in the activities of the university. “We shall also encourage visibility at the research level by putting in place a research and publication committee, which will organize conferences and collaborative publication in in­dexed journals.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Basking on quality of self­lessness, an attribute he said has been acknowledged by many in the university community, in­cluding some former Vice Chan­cellors, he said the pivot of his doings would be on “the desire to do what is right and do it well without necessarily hinging on personal benefit.”
