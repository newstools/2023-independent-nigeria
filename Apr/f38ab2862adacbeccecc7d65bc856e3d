ABUJA – The upper chamber of the National Assembly has un­covered how about 558 Min­istries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of gov­ernment failed to provide classification of intangible assets valued at N969 billion in the 2019 budget. The revelation was con­tained in the 2019 annual re­port of the Auditor-General of the Federation, which is being considered by the Senate Public Accounts Committee (SPAC). In the meeting chaired by the Vice Chairman of the Committee, Ibrahim Hassan Hadejia, senators expressed concern about the huge sum of money categorised as intangible assets in the 2019 budget as captured in the Auditor-General of the Federation’s report. The report read: “Audit ob­served from review of notes 36 and 36A (intangible) to the FGN consolidated financial statement (CFS) that: “The sum of N969 billion was recognised under notes 36A as intangible assets without a schedule show­ing the classification/na­ture of the intangible assets contrary to the provision of IPSAS 31. “There was no disclosure to enable the audit confirm which of the intangible as­sets has finite and infinite life, a bad for determina­tion whether amortisation should be or not.” In his response before the Senate committee, the rep­resentative of Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation, Shuaibu Sikiru, said that the template will be re-designed to accom­modate the observation in subsequent years.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Among the 558 agencies are State House, Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), Bureau of Public Procure­ment (BPP), National Popu­lation Commission (NPC), Federal College of Forest­ry, Ibadan; Federal College of Forestry, Jos; National Orientation Agency (NOA), Bureau of Public Service Reforms and Nigeria Police Academy, Wudili.
