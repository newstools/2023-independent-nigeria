SpaceX on Monday scrubbed a test for its massive Starship rocket after a pressurization issue occurred during the countdown leading up to the launch in Texas. SpaceX founder Elon Musk said the problem stemmed from a frozen pressurant valve. The company said that it would take at least 48 hours before another launch could be attempted. Musk tweeted that they “learned a lot” from the attempt and will retry in a “few days.” SpaceX describes Starship as a “fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo to Earth orbit, help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond.” Starship will transport astronauts to the surface of the moon for NASA’s Artemis program. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tried to set expectations low before the test. Before the launch, SpaceX said that “as is the case with all developmental testing, this schedule is dynamic and likely to change.” “Probably, tomorrow will not be successful,” Musk said on Sunday evening. “It’s just a very fundamentally difficult thing.” The rocket will launch from Texas and fly around part of Earth in orbit before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. SpaceX said that success for such a test is “measured by how much we can learn, which will inform and improve the probability of success in the future as SpaceX rapidly advances the development of Starship.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The company has completed several sub-orbital “hop tests” for Starship prototypes before, but this test would mark the first time the rocket will enter orbit around the Earth.
