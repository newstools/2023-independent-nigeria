ABUJA â€“ The former Vice President of Nigeria and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 presidential election, Atiku Abubakar has expressed shock and sadness over the passing away of Dr Chinwoke Mbadiniju, who governed Anambra State from 1999 to 2003. Atiku, in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday, decried the death of the former governor and a seasoned intellectual of the Ekwueme school of politics. According to Atiku, Mbadiniju was a quiet politician of note, who saw no need for unnecessary bickering and crisis-ridden politics in Anambra State when he lost the 2003 election. It was glaring, the Waziri of Adamawa noted, that Mbadinuju had learnt the politics of compromise from the great political leader and late former Vice President Alex Ekwueme under whom he received political tutelage. The former Vice President expressed his condolences to the Mbadinijus, and the government and people of Anambra State on the loss of this illustrious son and father who still had much to contribute in the development of the state in particular, and Nigeria in general. He urged the family to bear the loss with fortitude and prayed to God to grant Mbadinuju a peaceful repose.
