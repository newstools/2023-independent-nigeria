Manchester United will be looking to take a step closer to a second trophy of the season when they face Spanish side Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-finals on Thursday. -ADVERTISEMENT-Erik ten Hag’s side will welcome the Andalusian side to Old Trafford off the back of an impressive 2-0 win over Everton on Saturday, with Scott McTominay and Anthony Martial on the scoresheet against The Toffees. The Red Devils have already lifted the Carabao Cup this season, and remain in contention to win both the Europa League and the FA Cup. In the meantime, it appears that the club are plotting a move for a Spanish midfielder this summer. As reported by Football Insider, the Manchester club are considering a move for Celta Vigo star Gabri Veiga. The 20-year-old has been in fine form this season, making 29 appearances across all competitions including 26 La Liga games. The report claims that United have scouted the player a number of times so far this term, during what has been a breakthrough campaign for the youngster.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Veiga, a product of the club’s youth academy, made his debut during the 2020/21 campaign and played a bit-part role for the club last season. POLL This term, though, the Spain under-21 international has been a regular for the Galician side, although his performances haven’t gone unnoticed and Celta could now face a battle to keep hold of him. United are set to be in the market for at least one central midfielder this summer, with the likes of Fred and McTominay having been linked with a move away from Anfield. The club’s scouts have reportedly been very flattering in their reviews of the player, and United could therefore make a move to sign him when the window opens this summer. At present, Veiga is contracted to Celta Vigo until the summer of 2026, which would put the Spanish side in a commanding position during any potential negotiations.
