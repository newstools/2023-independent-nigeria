Coalition of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Youth Forum, has urged the National Secretariat of the party and its Senate caucus, to consider endorsing Senator- elect Simon Mwadkwon, as one of its principal officers in the 10th National Assembly. The Forum coordinator, Hon. Kabiru Garkuwa, made the call on Sunday in a chat with journalists in Jos. In his words, “considering the vast legislative experiences of Hon. Mwadkwon, who has served as House of Representatives Member in the 7th Assembly and is now serving in 9th Assembly, we are of the firm believe that he deserves to serve as one of the principal officers of the Senate,” he said. According to the group coordinator, Hon. Mwadkwon has remained a loyal, committed and determined adherent of the PDP’s ideology, as he has always put his weight and resources to the success of the party at all levels. “His loyaly, commitment and determination at moving the party forward knows no boundaries. “This is further to his stand for the party in the last general elections, at which he stood firmed to ensure that not only his senatorial candidature, but our Presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, won at his polling unit, while his likes were busy canvassing for the candidate of the Labour Party,” he said. Hon. Garkuwa stressed that, Hon. Mwadkwon is a real detribalised Nigerian, who sees everybody as his partner in the Nigerian project, hence the need for him to be considered of being one of the principal officers from the PDP/minority caucus. “We are urging the party and all Senators -elect under the banner of our great party, to consider endorsing him as one of the principal officers,” he further added.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
