Arsenal and Liverpool are set to go head-to-head for Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder Jesper Lindstrom, according to reports in Germany. Lindstrom has impressed for the Bundesliga side since completing his 2021 move from Brondby. The playmaker has contributed to 27 goals in 70 games for Frankfurt, seeing him linked with a move to the Premier League. The Gunners have been following the Denmark international for some time and according to Sport, were unsuccessful in their first move for the 23-year-old with a €30million (£26m) proposal turned down. Now, Sky Sports Germany journalist Florian Plettenberg has claimed both the Gunners and Liverpool have been in contact with Frankfurt over the player’s services. His price is understood to be in the region of €50m (£44m) but that is expected to fall between €35m (£30m) to €40m (£35m). Whilst the Gunners have the attractive prospect of playing in the Champions League next season, Jurgen Klopp’s men hold their own advantage in Lindstrom’s preference. Back in 2022, the Frankfurt star revealed he supports the Merseyside outfit. “I’ve always said I’m a Liverpool fan, so it could be sick cool to play for Liverpool at some point.” Lindstrom has also gone on record to discuss the rumours linking him with a move to Liverpool. In an interview with Viaplay (via BuliNews), he said: “When I heard about it, I was interested to know if it was actually true. I am a Liverpool man after all. “But there wasn’t more to it. It’s rumours, and rumours emerge really, really quickly. I can write something, someone else can write something and a third person can write something, and then it will be all over the media.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “I’m focusing on playing football and on doing what I can on the pitch to attract interest from clubs like these. It’s all about playing football for me. My team will take care of all the other stuff.”
