MINNA  – Former Nigeria’s Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (rtd) has called on Nigerians within and in the diaspora to give peace a chance by respect­ing and tolerating one another irrespective of religious, tribal and regional affiliations. Also the Etsu Nupe and Chairman Niger State Council of Traditional Rulers, Alhaji Ya­haya Abubakar has challenged adherents of the Islamic faith to fervently pray for smooth and successful transition, handover of power by President Muham­madu Buhari to an incoming civilian administration. Both personalities spoke after observing the two rakaats prayer to mark the year’s eid-el-fitr at the Minna Central prayer ground and at the Bida eid praying ground after the congregational prayers on Friday. The need for Nigerians, wher­ever they may find themselves to be peaceful and respect one an­other, former President Abdul­salam said has become necessary because there can be no mean­ingful development in a society where there is no respect for one another, especially in a heteroge­neous society like Nigeria. Also in Bida, the Etsu Nupe, Alhaji Yahaya Abubakar, while addressing his subjects shortly af­ter the two Raka’at prayers at the Bida Eid praying ground during congregational prayers on Fri­day emphasised that only fervent and ceaseless prayers would en­sure peaceful transition of power to the incoming administration.
