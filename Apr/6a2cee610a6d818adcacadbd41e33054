The Federal Government un­der President Muhammadu Buhari and his political party, the All Progressive Congress, have been urged to prioritize the revamping of the country’s refineries and tackle corrup­tion in the petroleum sector before removing fuel subsidy. Human Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA Resource Centre), a prominent Civil Society Organization, made the call in a statement signed by Olanrewaju Suraju, its Chairman on Sunday. HEDA expressed concerns over the state of the Nigerian petroleum industry and criti­cized the government’s plan to remove fuel subsidy without addressing corruption and revamping of the moribund refineries. Suraju noted that corrup­tion and mismanagement have plagued the Nigerian petroleum industry, leading to the poor state of the country’s refineries. He further emphasized that the government’s failure to revamp the refineries has re­sulted in over-reliance on im­ported fuel, contributing to the high cost of fuel and the need for subsidy. HEDA also alleged that the $800 million loan purportedly secured by the Nigerian Gov­ernment from the World Bank is not a solution to the fuel sub­sidy problem but a ploy by the bank and government officials to further plunge the country into debt and provide oppor­tunities to divert public funds under the guise of palliatives. Therefore, HEDA called on the government to take con­crete steps to revamp the refin­eries and clean up corruption bedeviling the sector.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ This according to HEDA in­cludes implementing policies that promote transparency and accountability, ensuring a transparent process in the award of contracts, and ap­pointing officials to oversee the refineries’ revamp. Also, to investigate the utilization of all the previous Turn Around Maintenance allocations to the refineries since 1999 to date. POLL HEDA believes that by focus­ing on these steps, the govern­ment can create a sustainable and viable petroleum industry that benefits all Nigerians.
