Milan are said to be interested in Arsenal’s bit-part winger Reiss Nelson, who could be available on a free transfer at the end of the 2022-23 season. The Rossoneri are in need of attacking reinforcements in the summer the priority will be to identify a striker to replace Divock Origi and Zlatan Ibrahimovic and alleviate the pressure from Olivier Giroud. But with the lack of goalscoring contributions from Ante Rebic and Charles De Ketelaere and Rafael Leao’s future uncertain, Milan are also in the market for a new winger as well. As reported in Calciomercato, the player’s agents have offered Nelson’s services to Milan if an extension at Arsenal doesn’t materialise before the end of the season and the Rossoneri could be tempted into making a move. For some years, the 23-year-old has been considered one of the most exciting talents to emerge from the club’s academy, but has never been able to cement a place in the first team line-up. The former England Under-21 international has experience of playing abroad after two successful loan spells in Germany with Hoffenheim, where he registered eight goals and an assist in 31 appearances, and with Feyenoord, where his tally stood at 11 goal contributions from 33 games. At points, Nelson has been involved in Arteta’s team during Arsenal’s table-topping Premier League campaign this season, but only ever as a replacement for Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ With Leandro Trossard’s arrival from Brighton in January, Nelson has slipped one further down the pecking order. POLL Still, from his 500 minutes of league football this season, Nelson has chipped in with three goals and three assists, but could be tempted into leaving North London in favour of regular first-team action.
