ENUGU – The management of Godfrey Okoye University, Enugu has banned staff and students from wearing short cloths to work and lectures. The institution, owned by the Catholic Diocese of Enugu, also banned the fixing of fingernails, eyelashes and other artificial materials on the body. The Vice Chancellor of the University, Rev. Fr. Prof. Christian Anieke, announced this on in Enugu while addressing staff and students of the university. He warned that the management would not tolerate staff or students who wear tights and other materials that expose sensitive parts of their bodies. According to him, such dressings distract other members of the university. He said that only black and brown hair would be allowed on campus and gave the staff and students one month to adjust to the new rules. He also announced that students would be expected to wear their faculty uniforms from Tuesdays to Fridays since students had abused the liberty to wear cultural attires on Fridays.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He said that the exchange of phonographic materials was a taboo in the institution.
