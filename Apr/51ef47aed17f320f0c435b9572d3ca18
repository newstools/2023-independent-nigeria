KANO –  The election petition tribunal sitting in Kano on Friday, struck out prayer by Air Commodore Salisu Yusha’u (retd) seeking the court to restrain the conduct of a rerun election in Doguwa/Tudun-Wada Federal Constituency. Already, the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC), has fixed April 15th to conclude the process. Justice L.B Lawal-Akapo, who presided over the proceedings at the National and State Houses of Assembly Election Petition Tribunal ruled that it lacks the jurisdiction to halt INEC from conducting the supplementary poll. The turn of events was brought about by the decision of the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC which had earlier declared Alhassan Ado Doguwa the winner of the election but made a u-turn and declared it inconclusive as the Returning Officer who supervised the election was said to have made the declaration under duress and threat. Counsel to the Applicant, Barrister Bashir Yusuf Tudun Wuzirci has approached the court challenging the decision of the Independent National Electoral Commission to go ahead with the rerun. The counsel submitted that the action of the Commission is challengeable by any of the contestants and that according to him the Tribunal has the power to look into the decision of the Commission as it relates to organising a rerun. The Tribunal invited counsel to the Applicant to address it on the issue he formulated.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The court subsequently struck out the application for lack jurisdiction.
