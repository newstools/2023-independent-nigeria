Dele Alli’s miserable Besiktas loan spell has hit a new low as the midfielder is set to return to Everton this weekend. Alli left Tottenham Hotspur to join Everton in February 2022 but has failed to impress. At the start of the 22/23 campaign, Alli moved to Turkish Super Lig side Besiktas on a season-long loan in a bid to reignite his career. However, his time in Turkey has been nothing short of a disaster as his performances have been way below par. Now, it has reached a new low as he is set to return to Goodison Park this weekend. According to Sky Sports, the 26-year-old is set to fly back to Merseyside on Saturday with Everton’s medical team to assess a muscle injury he recently suffered. Besiktas originally looked to cut short Alli’s loan deal during the January transfer window but were unable to do so as no break clause was included in the agreement.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ During his time with the Istanbul club, Alli was criticised by Besiktas’ coach Senol Gunes. POLL In January, Gunes said: “Dele Alli has had a good career. But he doesn’t deserve to play at the moment. The current situation has not met our expectations as a team. “We expect him to contribute to the team, but we think he cannot contribute at the moment. We will evaluate it with him and the club. We prepared for the matches with the players here. “We will make an evaluation by looking at these players in the match on Sunday. We will evaluate if there is a transfer. The transfer will be discussed in this month, as in all teams. I cannot answer this at the moment.” Most recently, Gunes accused Alli of going AWOL, which led to the Englishman defending himself on social media, claiming he was given permission by the club. Alli wrote: “Hey guys just had loads of messages so wanted to clear something up. “The club gave me permission to attend a doctor’s appointment today. I’m due back in training tomorrow as normal.” Alli is almost certain to leave Besiktas at the end of the season.
