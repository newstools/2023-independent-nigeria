Ten Hag has enjoyed an impressive first season at Old Trafford but knows more reinforcements are needed for United to challenge for major titles. United are expected to back the Dutch boss in the transfer market this summer, with Ten Hag especially keen to sign a new central midfielder. West Ham star Declan Rice has been strongly linked with a move to the Theatre of Dreams over the past 12 months and United retain interest in the 24-year-old. However, the Red Devils are also looking elsewhere for midfield reinforcements and have expressed interest in signing Caicedo and Mac Allister. The Daily Telegraph say Caicedo and Mac Allister have been placed on a shortlist of players considered as potential Manchester United signings. Caicedo was the subject of multiple failed bids from Arsenal during the January transfer window and wanted to join the Premier League leaders but was blocked from doing so by Brighton. The 21-year-old has since extended his contract at the Amex Stadium on improved terms but is nevertheless expected to be the figure of more interest come the summer.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Mac Allister – who helped Argentina win the World Cup in Qatar – was also linked with a move away from Brighton in January, with Chelsea especially interested in a deal. POLL But Manchester United are now also interested in securing his signature as they look to bolster Ten Hag’s squad and build on an encouraging season in which the team have won their first trophy since 2017 and moved into the top-four places. United could yet end the season with two more trophies as they face Sevilla in the quarter-finals of the Europa League and Brighton in the FA Cup semi-finals. Ten Hag’s side boosted their top-four hopes with a routine 2-0 win over Everton on Saturday and the ex-Ajax boss said: ‘We have to be more clinical and more ruthless and this game has to be finished by half time and we didn’t. ‘But it is still a very good performance and it is still a big compliment to the team.’
