LAGOS  – Emmanuel Oghene Egor, law­maker representing Amuwo Odofin constituency in the Green Chamber of the National Assem­bly, on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has faulted the bill seeking medical graduates to serve Nigeria for five years before they can be allowed to travel overseas for greener pasture. Oghene who spoke on Arise TV on Sunday said that the bill is not good for the country, the medical association, and is dis­criminatory. He said, “There are students who went to private universities, what will happen if some finish from the private university as doctors or dentists and another group went to public universities, and you will withhold the certifi­cates of those who went to public universities and allow those who went to private universities to go. “Secondary, the way the feder­al government has held the medi­cal profession, it is not very clear, because I know that unless some­one is on scholarship, all students pay school fees. I don’t want to agree with the insinuation that Nigeria trains them for free. He added, “In Nigeria a lot of students have finished university and cannot go for “Houseman­ship”, and for two or three years they will be looking for teaching hospitals to go for “Houseman­ship”. “I will suggest that the govern­ment should expand facilities for “Housemanship”, so that people don’t graduate as medical doc­tors and sit at home, waiting for a chance to go for “Houseman­ship”. The lawmaker added, “If any government from the developed clime, is ready to take in our fresh medical graduates, to train them for us, I think we should be happy, because when they travel abroad they will be exposed to newer methods of treating people, will be used to modern medical equip­ment, and I can tell you that after sometime most of them will re­turn to Nigeria.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “When they come back, they will work with advanced knowl­edge, and that will help the coun­try. For example in India in the 50s and 70s, those who travelled to Britain, after training remained there, but in the late 80s they started coming back to India, and they returned with a lot of medical knowledge.
