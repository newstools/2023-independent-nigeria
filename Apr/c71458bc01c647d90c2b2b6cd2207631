ABUJA  – Former National Assembly members have cautioned against zoning of legislative positions alongside those of the executive arm of govern­ment. Rising from a one-day sensitisation parley with some state Assembly mem­bers-elect in Jos, Plateau State, the ex-legislators called on the leadership of various political par­ties, president and gover­nors-elect not to interfere with the election of National Assembly principal officers. According to the commu­nique signed by Hon. Golu Timothy, former Chief Whip of the Plateau State House of Assembly and member of the 8th House of Repre­sentatives, the former leg­islators including senators, House of Representatives and state Assembly prin­cipal officers and other re­source persons who spoke at the event, averted that ex­ecutive offices are different from legislative positions, hence must exist on their respective merits whether the occupants come from the same zone. While noting that such does not add value to dem­ocratic principles nor does it promotes separation of powers, checks and bal­ances, they underscored the need to allow mem­bers-elect to exercise their franchise without any in­terference. The ex-lawmakers main­tained that allowing for a natural course of leadership brings better harmony and understanding, mutual re­spect and less politicisation. They agreed that having a legislative officer from the same zone with any ex­ecutive officer should not be an issue because they have different roles and respon­sibilities to perform and will be assessed based on their respective constitutionally assigned duties.
