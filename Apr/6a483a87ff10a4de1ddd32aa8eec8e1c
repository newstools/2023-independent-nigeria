As part of the renewed charge to reduce environmental infractions, monitor Lagos environs in line with global best practices and make Lagos habitable which is in line with the T.H.E.M.E.S agenda of Mr. Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Lagos Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC/KAI) has effected the arrest of a vendor for selling expired canned foods (SARDINE) at the Bolade-Oshodi area of the State. Speaking on the development at the Command Headquarters of the Agency, the Corps Marshal, CP Gbemisola Akinpelu (retd) expressed shock at such a nefarious act, citing the negative health damages caused to unsuspecting consumers of expired foods. According to her, ‘‘our men on routine daily patrol of the market environment around Oshodi acted on a tip-off and laid siege for the subsequent arrest of a vendor involved in sales of expired canned food dating back to Y2020, Mrs. Surajat Balogun at 7:55 AM with 79 pieces of expired (GARBA TUNA SARDINE) at Bolade-Oshodi’’. Speaking further, the Corps Marshal directed that the suspect and products be handed to the Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency (LACOPA) for onward confiscation and subsequent prosecution to serve as a deterrent to others. Also commenting on the arrest, the General Manager of Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency (LASCOPA), Mr. Afolabi Solebo Esq. avowed that the suspect will face prosecution, admonished Lagosians to beware of expired products and report cases on consumer rights abuse to the Agency. Akinpelu finally urged Lagosians to desist from patronizing street traders, citing that the majority of them are involved in the sales of expired products to unsuspecting members of the public in transit.
