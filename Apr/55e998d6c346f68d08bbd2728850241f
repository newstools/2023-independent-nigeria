LAGOS – The operatives of the Force Criminal Investigations Department (Force-CID), Lagos Annex, Alagbon, have disclosed how two suspects, Tope Ojo  and Nojeem Haruna were arrested for their alleged complicity in a case of economic sabotage. They were alleged to have been engaged in the diversion of aviation fuel valued about N46 million. The arrest, according to Oluniyi Ogundeyi, Public Relations Officer, Force CID, Lagos Annex, Alagbon,  followed a petition addressed to the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Alkali Baba, by a civic-minded Nigerian, where the Force-CID was alerted of plots by some hoodlums to intercept and divert petroleum products worth billions of Naira. Ogundeyi, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said preliminary investigations by the Annex, in compliance with the IGP’s directives, revealed that a tanker-trailer loaded with aviation fuel was intercepted by the  principal suspect – Tope Ojo  and his gang members at Ilesha in Osun State. “The suspects, having taken control of the tanker-trailer, successfully trans-loaded the product into another tanker before proceeding to maliciously destroy the initial tanker conveying the product. “Detailed investigations conducted by the Force-CID, Lagos Annex, Alagbon, have since established a prima facie case of economic sabotage, diversion of aviation fuel, stealing and malicious damage, against the arrested suspects and other members of their gang still at large,” the Police image maker added. Meanwhile, investigators from the Annex are beaming their search light on habitual receivers of these stolen products and other suspects, that aid and abet the crime by providing transportation and storage facilities for the stolen products.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) in-charge of the Force-CID, Lagos Annex, Alagbon, AIG Frank Mba, mni has ordered the investigators to ensure that all suspects linked to the crime are arrested and brought to book.
