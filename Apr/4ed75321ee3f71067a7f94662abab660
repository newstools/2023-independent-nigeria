The Anambra State Association of Town Unions (ASATU) has called on Ndi-Anambra to use the Easter celebration to pray for the state governor Professor Charles Chukwuma Soludo and leaders of various communities in the state. National President of ASATU, Chief Barr. Titus Nnabuike Akpudo who made the call in the press statement he released to journalists in Awka on Good Friday, also urged citizens to show love and compassion to one another especially the downtrodden and less privileged ones, emphasizing that there is love in sharing with others. Akpudo said Gov. Soludo and community leaders needed the prayers and supplications of the people to enable them carry on with the onerous task of improving their living conditions through interventions as well as life-changing programmes. He categorically stated that the governor required the prayers and support of the people to enable him actualise his mission and vision of a prosperous new Anambra state, judging from what he has put in place in the last one year. Akpudo in the statement, said that ASATU would partner the state government in environmental cleanliness to ensure that the culture of environmental cleanliness trickled down to the remotest communities where he said Presidents-General would play very crucial role during the exercise. He equally called on other stakeholders in the communities to endeavour to sensitise as well as educate the people especially those at the grassroots to actively participate in the forthcoming National Census exercise as such programmes helped government in obtaining accurate data for planning and execution of development programmes even as he prayed to God to grant everyone a hitch-free Easter vacation.
