An attack by suspected jihadists killed 33 soldiers in eastern Burkina Faso on Thursday, the army said. A contingent of troops came across “a complex, large-scale attack” in the east region, which also left 12 soldiers wounded, according to an army statement. The soldiers “neutralized at least 40 terrorists before the arrival of reinforcements” during the “particularly intense fighting,” it added. The wounded troops were evacuated and were being treated by the health services, the army said. Burkina Faso has been grappling with a bloody jihadist insurgency since 2015, when unrest spilled over from neighboring Mali. Fighting between the security forces and groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group has left thousands dead and forced millions of people to flee their homes.
