ABUJA  – The Abuja Property Development Company (APDC) has made plans to deploy innovative approaches to increase the revenue base for Federal Capital Territory Administration, it has been learned. APDC Board Chairman, Alhaji Idris Malagi, stated this while inaugurating new members in Abuja, stressing that their commitment to productivity and profit will be to meet the objectives. Malagi said the board plans to kick-start the Centenary City project and the construction of district hospitals. The company would also focus on establishing new hotel and conference facilities, adding that the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) minister has given the initial approval on some of which they are currently undergoing regulatory processes. “We are already identifying those to help us in achieving the projects. We’ll be meeting them and making our roadmap known to the public,” he said. Malagi, who is returning for a second term as chairman of the APDC Board, stressed that they have successfully settled most of its debt during the first tenure, and would look forward to stabilising and growing the firm. He declared: “The primary thing is the need to boost and grow the company first. The firm was really in very bad shape. We owed so many contractors and others. But we are glad that all that is passed. “During the period under review, we were able to bring back the company to its profitability. Now we can say that APDC does not owe anybody, as it is standing on its feet and growing. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “We intend to develop the conference facility of the newly built headquarter.”
