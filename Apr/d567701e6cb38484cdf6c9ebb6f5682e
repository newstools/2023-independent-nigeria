The Spanish tactician, who worked under greats such as Pep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti during his playing days, has made a promising start to life in coaching, having impressed since he took the Leverkusen job. According to the Sun, heâ€™s now in contention to take over from Moyes at West Ham after what is likely to go down as a disappointing season, even if the Hammers do manage to stay up. It remains to be seen if Alonso is quite ready to make the step up to managing in a competitive league like the English top flight, but it would be intriguing to see what he could do at a club who have generally been under-achievers for many years. Alonso is still inexperienced, but looks like he could be worth trusting as a long-term option to develop an exciting new-look project at the London Stadium. Moyes was doing very well with West Ham until a dip in form this season and it might now be time for a change.
