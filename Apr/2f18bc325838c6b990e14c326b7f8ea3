Former Senate President, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki has congratulated Christians across the world on the suc­cessful completion of this year’s Lent period and the subsequent Good Friday and Easter celebrations which symbolize the death and res­urrection of Jesus Christ. In a message from his Me­dia Office in Abuja, Saraki urged Nigerian Christians to pray for peace, security, sustainable development, and unity in the country as well as among the citizens. He urged Christians to return to the teachings of Jesus Christ who as ‘the rea­son for the season’ represents religious tolerance, peaceful co-existence, good faith, truth, demonstration of the fear of and belief in God, empathy for the less privileged, and patriotism to one’s country. “It is not just a mere coin­cidence that while the Lent fasting was on, the Muslim Ramadan also commenced and this translates to a very substantial percent­age of the national popula­tion fasting in the past two weeks. This is a design by Almighty God to teach us the lesson that no matter how we worship Him, what­ever language we adopt in worshipping Him, or what name we call Him, we are all creations of one God. “Therefore, we should all live, work and aspire together as brothers and sisters in the interest of our dear country, demonstrate the fear of God in all we do, and develop our country for the benefit of all. We should stop allowing reli­gion, ethnicity, or difference in language to divide us. It is time we all bound together to salvage our country and restore her lost glory. “This Easter period which also coincides with the ongoing Ramadan fasting should be used by Nigerians to pray for their country, to rededicate our­selves to the promotion of national interest above personal interest, ponder about the challenges facing the country, and for each in­dividual to take a vow to be part of the solution to the problems.“
