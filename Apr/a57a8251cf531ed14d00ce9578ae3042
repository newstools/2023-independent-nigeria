The National Drug Law Enforce­ment Agency, NDLEA, has dis­closed that a trending video of some persons wearing red jackets similar to the ones used by the of­ficers and men of the agency for operational purposes, operating in a minibus, is an old skit, which the agency had disclaimed a year ago. NDLEA said those in the video are not its officers. The agency had in a well-pub­licised statement released on Sat­urday, May 21, 2022 stated that it had established, following a series of public inquiries, that the video with screenshot pictures attached to the statement is a skit produced by one Mathew C. Eze who lives in the Lekki area of Lagos. A year after, the video has re­turned to the social media space, a development that has led to sever­al inquiries from concerned mem­bers of the public on the authen­ticity of the content of the video. “We will like to reiterate that the confusion the controversial video has created in the minds of members of the public under­scores the need for some social media content producers to show restraint, responsibility and de­corum in how they misuse par­aphernalia of law enforcement officers to avoid misconceptions and insinuations,” it said. The agency will also like to re­mind those fond of this kind of in­discretion, especially the misuse of its official jackets to mislead and create false impressions, that such has consequences, the state­ment by Femi Babafemi, Director, Media & Advocacy NDLEA Head­quarters, Abuja, read.
