The Northern Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has told the Group Chief Exec­utive Officer of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corpo­ration Limited (NNPCL), Kolo Mele Kyari, to step aside to allow for an unfet­tered probe by the House of Representatives into the payment of N20 billion to a ghost consultant. The group alleged that the NNPC manipulated the fuel subsidy regime, which according to it, was seen during the acute fuel scarcity that lasted over six months when Nigerians were buying fuel for N400 per litre, while the Federal Government spending on subsidy skyrocketed. The group, in a press statement on Monday signed by its president, Comrade Isah Abubakar, urged the House of Representatives to probe the NNPC beyond the N20 billion contract scam, even as it threatened a massive civil protest if the GCEO refused to step aside. The group also urged oth­er Civil Society Organisa­tions (CSOs) to join it in the struggle to hold the NNPCL accountable for its actions. “The Northern Youth Council of Nigeria believes that a thorough investiga­tion into the payment of N20 billion to a ghost consultant is necessary to ensure trans­parency and accountability in the management of Nige­ria’s oil and gas industry,” it said. While calling on the House of Representatives to take action and investigate the NNPC, NYCN noted that the outcome of the investi­gation would help to restore the confidence of Nigerians in the oil and gas industry and the government as a whole. “NYCN is committed to ensuring that the NNPC is held accountable for its ac­tions and that the manage­ment of Nigeria’s oil and gas industry is transparent and accountable.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “We believe that the fu­ture of Nigeria’s oil and gas industry depends on the actions taken by the gov­ernment and the NNPC to address the issues raised by the payment of N20 billion to a ghost consultant,” the statement added.
