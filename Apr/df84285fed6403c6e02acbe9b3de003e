The current ceasefire began at midnight local time on Monday, pausing a conflict which erupted on Sunday 15 April amid a power struggle between the leaders of the army and the RSF. The BBC reports that, despite the ceasefire, fighting has also broken out in the city of Omdurman, near to the capital city of Khartoum. People in both cities are reportedly struggling to find food and water, and access cash. There have also been reports of looting homes and empty buildings, and cars and other vehicles. Meanwhile, the Sudanese Health Ministry on Thursday (27 April) put the death toll at 512, with another 4,193 being injured since the fighting broke out. Many countries have evacuated diplomats and citizens from Sudan, and diplomatic efforts to extend the current ceasefire are ongoing.
