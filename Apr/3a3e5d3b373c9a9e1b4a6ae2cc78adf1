UMUAHIA  – General Yakubu Gowon, former Head of State and founder of Ni­geria Prays, has given reasons why he postponed a prayer rally billed to usher in the adminis­tration of Dr Alex Otti in Abia State. The prayer rally, billed for April 23, 2023 at the Master’s Vessel Church, Umuahia, was expected to attract some digni­taries, top clergymen and wom­en as well as the governor-elect, Dr Alex Otti. However, the programme was called off abruptly by the organizers. The Coordinator of the Nigeria Prays in the state, Apostle Chuks Alozie, told our reporter at the weekend in an in­terview that the Yakubu Gowon suspended the programme be­cause of the criticisms the proj­ect attracted within Abia State and across the country. It will be recalled that apart from the state wing of the Peo­ples Democratic Party (PDP) which expressed reservation over the visit of the former Head of State to prayer Alex Otti and others persons threw jabs at him. PDP subsequently asked him to apologize to the Igbo over his role in the Nigeria civil war, and other personalities before com­ing to hold a Prayer rally. Alozie, while regretting the inconveniences the suspension may have caused to those al­ready invited, said the General and Nigeria Prays cannot be dragged into politics, adding that it was a genuine effort to usher in a new era in the state and not to support any person or politi­cal power in Abia State. “We will continue to pray and strive for the peace and unity of Nigeria, especially Abia State”, Apostle Alozie quoted the Gen­eral to have said during the in­terview.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The governor elect, Dr Alex Otti, who won the March 18, 2023 governorship poll under the La­bour Party, was to be billed as the special guest at the Prayer Rally.
