EJIKEME OMENAZU A cleric, Rev Dr Kalu Ofon Emmanuel, the President, Cloud of Glory Outreach Ministries, Lagos, has said that the prosperity gospel has been making a positive impact on the Nigerian Church. Speaking with Sunday INDEPENDENT, Rev Emmanuel maintained that in the 1980s, Christians were easily identified with poverty that was written all over their faces. He maintained that Christians hitherto looked very tattered in dressing; even as to some the use of perfumes was considered a sin or taboo. By then, he stated, “The television was like a devil’s box. When Archbishop Benson A. Idahosa of the blessed memory, started preaching prosperity gospel, it brought Christianity out of the darkness of awkward and primitive dressing and thinking to limelight. “For Christians, their eyes opened to the realisation and reality that they should dress well, have good cars, dwell in good houses, run good businesses, get well educated etc. “They were so heavenly conscious and became earthly useless. Most Christians never believed they could be rich. The positive impact is much.” Rev Emmanuel, however, maintained that the prosperity gospel also has a negative impact, which has affected the church till date if not well balanced.
