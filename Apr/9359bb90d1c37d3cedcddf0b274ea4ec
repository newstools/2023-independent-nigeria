Excerpts: What led you to the recycling business? My quest for survival led me to recycling business. I was struggling to make ends meet and had no reliable source of income. At first, I tried selling cement, but I was robbed of my capital by armed robbers. My husband suggested I try recycling, and though I was reluctant, I am now grateful that I did because I have touched the lives of many people and I am glad I did. What area of recycling are you into and why? I specialise in recycling waste plastics and industrial nylon films. I chose this field because there is a readily available market both locally and internationally. What are the potential opportunities in this business? POLL The opportunities in waste plastics recycling are significant and diverse. Waste plastics recycling presents several potential opportunities, including; environmental benefits; economic benefits, innovations and technological advancement; resources conservation; job creation, products diversity and corporate sustainability. For environmental benefit, recycling waste plastics reduces the amount of plastics waste that ends up in the landfills or the natural environment, which can have significant environmental benefits, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving resources, and reducing the harm of plastics on wildlife. Recycling waste can create economic opportunities in various ways, such as creating jobs in the recycling industry, reducing the cost of waste management for municipalities and businesses, and creating new markets for recycled plastic products. Resources conservation; recycling plastic reduces the need for new plastics to be produced, which conserves natural resources such as oil and gas. Recycling plastic waste can be cheaper than producing new plastic, particularly if the plastic waste is sorted and cleaned before recycling. The recycling industry creates jobs in the collection, sorting, processing, and manufacturing of recycled plastic products. Do I need any form of training before venturing into this business? Yes, itâ€™s important to have some training before starting a waste plastic recycling business. While the recycling business may seem simple, it requires specific knowledge and skills to ensure that the process is safe, efficient, and effective. You must understand the type of plastics.

Businesses, offices, factories, and other industrial establishments generate significant amounts of waste plastics that can be collected for recycling. Landfills and dumpsites are also potential sources of waste plastics. However, it is important to ensure that the waste collected from this site is sorted to avoid contamination. There are informal sectors of waste pickers who collect waste plastics from streets, markets, and other public places. These waste pickers can be a source of waste plastics for recycling.
