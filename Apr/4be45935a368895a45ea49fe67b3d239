A Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State, Olorogun Vincent Sito, has condemned an alleged suspension of the Governorship candidate of the party, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege by some faceless persons. Sito, in a statement, described the alleged suspension by some sponsored faceless persons as unfounded and has no effect on the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege. He noted that the alleged suspension was the handiwork of those who are bent on bringing the good name of the Delta state Governorship candidate of the APC to repute by any means. According to him, “the APC in Delta state has an elected executive led by Chief Omeni Sobotie, anyone parading himself outside the Chief Sobotie-led executive is an enemy of democracy and shall be dealt with in accordance with the laws of the land. “We know those behind the purported suspension of our revered Deputy Senate President. They are not far from those that were recently suspended from the party on anti-party issues. “I called on the general public to disregard the illegal suspension of the Deputy Senate President and Delta State Governorship candidate of the APC, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege as those behind it have no locus standi to do so”, it added.
