Tanzanian boxer, Twalib Tuwa, has vowed to end the unbeaten run of London-based Nigerian boxer and World Boxing Federation (WBF) Intercontinental featherweight champion, Taiwo “Esepor” Agbaje, when they face each other at GOtv Boxing Night 28. The highly anticipated contest is one of the seven bouts lined up for the boxing showpiece, at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Indoor Sports Hall of  Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos, on 1 May. Speaking in a telephone interview from his training base in Tanzania, Tuwa said Esepor’s unbeaten status is because he is yet to face a lion like him. “I fight like a lion in the ring. I don’t hold back. I have heard of Esepor’s record. I am more experienced than him and I will end his record on 1 May,” he said. Tuwa has a record of 37 bouts with 25 wins, nine losses, and three draws. 17 of his victories came via knockout. Meanwhile, Esepor, who is ranked 39th in the world by the WBF, has also bragged that he will eat up Tuwa like the popular Nigerian meal, ‘Tuwo’. The Nigerian is undefeated in his 15 bouts, including two in the UK, winning eight via knockout. In the other bouts of the night, cruiserweight boxers, Demiji Salami, and Samuel Elegbede will slug it out in a six-round national super middleweight challenge bout; lightweight boxers, Emmanuel Abimbola and Prince Lion Nwoye will face each other; Dolapo Omole will battle Gbolahan Mojeed in an eight-round featherweight bout; Steven “Freeman” Kadima will face Godwin Ambrose in a national challenge duel; Samuel ‘Apata Roro’ Moses, and Michael Adeshodun will pummel each other, while Azeez Ayobami ‘Latest’ will engage  Tosin Osaigbovo, in an eight-round national lightweight challenge bout.
