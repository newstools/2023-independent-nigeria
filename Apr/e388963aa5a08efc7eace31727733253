It is indeed a good work by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu and to check the bad eggs so that nobody will ever take this country for granted “We thank the Almighty God for the success of the election, and for Ahmadu Fintiri to have emerged as governor-elect to serve for another four years. He added, “Adamawa people have spoken, and we want to thank every person that has contributed directly or indirectly in ensuring that the constitution of Nigeria has been complied with.
