ABUJA – The Federal Gov­ernment has an­nounced that it would spend a to­tal of N46.1billion for the provision of broadband connection in some se­lected higher institutions of learning, airports and markets in the country. Prof. Isa Pantami, Minis­ter of Communications and Digital Economy, stated this on Thursday in Abuja during the presentation of award let­ters to the representatives of the beneficiary schools and airports. Pantami explained that under the first phase of the broadband provision that 18 universities, one College of Education and 20 markets for Small and Medium Enterpris­es were given award letters in November 2022. It would be recalled that the Federal Government, last Wednesday, approved the sum of N24.20bn for the provision of broadband internet con­nection in at least 20 airports, 43 schools and six marketplaces nationwide. Pantami had told State House Correspondents after the Federal Executive Council meeting that the selected local and international airports were drawn from the six geo­political zones, with three air­ports from each on average. He also said that the higher institutions of learning and markets that will benefit from the five-month project are also drawn from the geopolitical zones. He said the broadband infrastructure would ensure connectivity in airports, ease e-learning in schools and ease mobile transactions in markets as the economy goes cashless.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He added that the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) would be the implement­ing institution.
