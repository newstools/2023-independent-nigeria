Veteran defender Pepe has renewed his contract with FC Porto, the Portuguese side announced in a statement on Sunday. The 40-year-old team captain will stay with the club until 2024. Pepe said the new deal “means a lot” for him and he committed to it “with great pleasure.” Pepe, who played for a while for Turkish club Besiktas between 2017 and 2018, clinched three UEFA Champions League and three Spanish La Liga titles during his 10-year-run with Real Madrid between 2007 and 2017.
