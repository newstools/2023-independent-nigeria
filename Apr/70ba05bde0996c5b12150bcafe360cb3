ABUJA  – The race for the leader­ship of the 10th Senate took a fresh dimension on Tuesday as Senator repre­senting Imo-West Senato­rial district, Osita Izunaso stormed the Presidential Villa, Abuja to persuade the President, Muhammadu Buhari on why the position of Senate President should be zoned to the South East. Izunaso, a ranking mem­ber of the National Assembly is also throwing his hat in the ring, boasting that he is more qualified and suited for the position. He wants the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, where he has functioned as National Organising Secre­tary to decide on the zoning principle as a fair bargain for the South East. The lawmaker is up against the Senate Chief Whip, and former gover­nor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu who is also eyeing the position alongside others like the governor of Ebonyi State Dave Umahi. Senator Izunaso marks the third interested aspirant to visit the Presidential villa. During a brief conversation with State House Correspon­dents, Izunaso said, “We are waiting for the party to zone the position to us. It is only fair and natural that the position be zoned to the South-East. ” Blowing his trumpet, he said he remains the highest ranking Senator therefore; he will vie for the post of the Senate President.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Asked what he discussed with the President upon his visit to the seat of power, he said, “We discussed issues concerning the 10th Senate with my host the President extensively. Since I am the oldest Senator in both the South-East and South-South, it is obvious that I am vying. There is no senator today in APC of South-East or South- South extraction that is older than me in the Senate. POLL “The Senate is an institu­tion that believes in ranking. I was in the House of Repre­sentatives before; I have been in the party for five good solid years, I ran the party as Na­tional Organizing Secretary of the APC, which saw us to victory in 2015 and 2019. So, I think we have paid our dues”.
