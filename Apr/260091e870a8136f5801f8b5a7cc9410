ABUJA  – President Muhammadu Bu­hari on Thursday wielded the big stick by approving the im­mediate suspension from office of Hudu Yunusa-Ari, Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) of Adamawa State. The suspension is to allow the completion of investigation by the Inspector General of Po­lice on the conduct/actions of the REC during the supplemen­tary election in Adamawa State. Recall that Yunusa-Ari had drawn the condemnation of Nigerians when he announced the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Aisha Binani, as winner of the supplementa­ry elections while collation of results were yet to be conclud­ed. The president, through a statement by the Secretary to the Government of the Feder­ation, Boss Mustapha, also di­rected the immediate investiga­tion and prosecution, if found liable, of Hudu Yunusa-Ari by the Inspector General of Police. The president equally di­rected investigation by the Inspector General of Police, Director-General of the Depart­ment of State Services, and the Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil De­fence Corps of the role of their officers in aiding and abetting the conduct/actions of Hudu Yunusa-Ari and if found cul­pable, appropriate disciplinary actions, to be meted out to them.
