LAGOS  – The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Ports and Terminals Multipurpose Services Limited (PTML) Command, has said that it netted the sum of N43.721 billion into the Federation account in the first quarter of 2023. The command also said it recorded an increase in the compliance level of importers, exporters, and licensed customs agents. This, according to the Customs Public Relations, PTML Command, Yakubu Mohammad, a Chief Superintendent of Customs (CSC), in a statement made available to DAILY INDEPENDENT, followed sustained sensitization embarked on by Comptroller AM Ibrahim, the Customs Area Controller (CAC) of the Command. A month-by-month breakdown of the collection showed improvement in March 2023 above the figures of January and February generated by the Command, this year. In January, according to the Customs image maker, the command collected N14,748,081,466.31. He added that the February collection was a total of N13,129,893,878.68, while the March collection was N15,843,240,431.76. Addressing senior officers of the Command at a recent meeting, Comptroller Ibrahim expressed optimism that there would be a steady improvement in the latter parts of the year with strategies put in place. The CAC said there was a conscious drive to continually block suspected areas of revenue leakages while enlisting more support from all government agencies and private sector operators in ensuring a high level of compliance. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He commended the officers for their application of knowledge acquired through training and experience in detecting some areas of revenue shortfalls for which demand notices were issued to recover N477.8 million between January and March 2023. POLL On anti-smuggling, the Command made two seizures worth Duty Paid Value (DPV) of N10,487,800 with the interception and seizure of 2x40ft containers marked ACLU9664782 and ACLU9715690. The containers were laden with 2,598 pieces of used motor tyres; 18 pieces of used washing machines and fridges, used mattresses, and other used household items. On export, it was disclosed that a total of 1,932 containers were processed through the PTML Command of NCS in the period under review. The total tonnage weight of the goods was 38,137.66 with a Free On Board (FOB) value of $48,006,020.41, which is equivalent to N20,272,942,419.14 at an exchange rate of N422.3 to $1. Export items through the command include cocoa beans, sesame seeds, hibiscus flowers, dried ginger, noodles, beverages, cosmetics, and others. Under Comptroller Ibrahim, the command achieved a major milestone by obtaining access to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Trade Monitoring System (TRMS) portal. This online access now makes the inspection of declarations easier and faster. For trade facilitation, since the command deals more with Roll on Roll Off (vehicular) cargoes, it became imperative to assist in removing some traffic obstacles on the port access route. There is a remarkable improvement in the conduct of examinations by officers, hence preserving the record 4-hour clearance time of vehicles for compliant declarants. The well-being of officers on duty has also received a boost with the establishment of a fully equipped clinic to address health matters at work. The CAC thanked the Comptroller General, Col. Hameed Ibrahim Ali (Rtd), for his unwavering support, mentoring examples, and motivation which contribute to the progress of PTML Command.
