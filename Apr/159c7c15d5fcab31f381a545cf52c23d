LAGOS – Operatives of the Lagos State Traffic Manage­ment Authority (LAST­MA) have rescued three severely injured accident victims, two males, and a female, in multiple crashes at Mosalasi Roundabout inward Iyana-Ipaja area of Lagos. Akanji Wasiu (Bravo 16) who led the rescue operations, con­firmed that the accident involved three vehicles, a Mazda commer­cial bus (FKJ 88 XH), a Tricycle (Keke Marwa KJA 369 QM), and a white Camry car (KJA 351 HG) on the main carriageway at Iya­na-Ipaja area of Lagos. It was gathered that the driv­er of a white Camry car lost con­trol from over-speeding and hit a commercial tricycle from the rear while the tricycle went off balance to obstruct another on­coming fully loaded Mazda com­mercial bus going to Iyana-Ipaja. The rescued accident victims were immediately rushed to dif­ferent hospitals by their relations but one of the rescued victims (male) reportedly died on the way to the hospital. The damaged vehicles were immediately removed to allow free flow of traffic and handed over to Policemen from Gowon Estate Divisional Police Head­quarters for further investiga­tion. One of the passengers in the commercial tricycle involved in the crash was caught with more than 100 pieces of used chil­dren’s Diapers Pampers’ and a huge sum of money in different denominations. He was immedi­ately handed over to Policemen at the scene of the accident. The General Manager of LASTMA, Mr. Bolaji Oreagba, stated that it was a ‘man-made’ accident that could be prevented if over-speeding were avoided.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He revealed that the govern­ment had embarked on regular public education on the danger inherent in over-speeding by private, commercial, and truck drivers across the state. POLL Mr. Oreagba, however, warned the motoring public to ensure their vehicles are in good condition, particularly the break before driving them on Lagos roads.
