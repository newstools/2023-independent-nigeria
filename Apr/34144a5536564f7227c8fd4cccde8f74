Ohanaeze Ndigbo has said that omission of Igbos in the APC Transition Committee is a bad omen. The group said that a good number of Igbo sons and daughters gave valid support to the APC during the recent elections only for them to be sidelined so early in the Senator Bola Tinubu political arrangements. A press statement issued by Secretary General of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Mazi Okechuwu Isiguzoro stated that, “Ndigbo condemn in strong terms the deliberate attempts to cajole the sacrifices of prominent Igbo sons and daughters to ensure that APC secured 25% votes across the Igbo-speaking provinces. It’s too early for this anti-Igbo hatred to manifest and we call the President-Elect to use his powers to avert this eyesore of fallacy trending and correct this negligence and gaffe. We believe that such correction will be the beginning of the healing process and national reconciliation “. “We are looking forward to seeing that the incoming President, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu ensures that Southeast gets the President of the Senate and the formation of the Government of National Unity remains the escape route for National peace and security” “He should not allow persons with evil intentions against the people of the southeast to send wrong signals that Tinubu has reciprocated Igbo’s supports with disdain and hatred”.
