Barca signed Raphinha in a £55 million deal from Leeds United last July and after initially struggling to make an impact, the Brazil international has been in superb form with nine goals and 10 assists in 42 appearances so far this season. The Spanish club have also held talks to bring Messi back to Camp Nou with their former talisman available on a free transfer this summer once his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expires. However, La Liga has insisted that Barcelona need to drastically cut their wage bill or raise around €200m (£177.1m) in player sales this summer in order to enable the club to register new players. According to AS, Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle United have retained their interest in Raphinha ahead of the summer window and some members of Barca’s board are open to selling the 26-year-old if they receive a significant return on their initial £55m outlay last year. The report also claims that Raphinha does not feel completely valued by Barca and the club would use his sale in order to pave the way for Messi to return. Xavi, meanwhile, has given no indication that he would be willing to part with Raphinha after just one season. Speaking in February, Xavi described the Brazilian as ‘the future of Barcelona’.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ ‘He’s a criticised player but he does a lot and we value him a lot,’ Xavi said. POLL ‘We will always support Raphinha – he’s the future of Barcelona.’ Arsenal were keen to sign a winger in the January transfer window and after losing out to Chelsea in the race to sign Mykhailo Mudryk, reports in Spain claimed that the Gunners failed with a €70m (£61.7m) bid to sign Raphinha. However, Barcelona turned down Arsenal’s approach and Mikel Arteta’s side went on to land Leandro Trossard in a £27m deal from Brighton.
