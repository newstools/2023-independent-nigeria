As the national Federa­tion/ Aiteo Cup 2023 hits the round of 64 stages across various stadia in the country, multiple cup winners, Rangers Interna­tional F.C will have former premiership side, Adama­wa United F.C of Yola to contend with at FIFA Goal Project Pitch, Abuja on Thursday, April 27, 2023. After the draws orga­nized by Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), in Abu­ja, the ‘Flying Antelopes’ were handed the boys from Yola as the coach Ab­dul Maikaba tutored side aim to be crowned cham­pions again after the 2018 triumph. Winners of the Feder­ation/Aiteo Cup earn an automatic ticket to repre­sent the country in next season’s CAF Confedera­tion Cup. In another develop­ment, the Interim Man­agement Committee (IMC) organizers of the NPFL have rescheduled the match day 15 fixture between Dakkada F.C of Uyo and Rangers Interna­tional F.C earlier fixed for Saturday, April 22, 2023, to now be played on Monday, April 24, 2023, with kick­off scheduled for 2pm at the Godswill Akpabio In­ternational Stadium, Uyo. Correspondence from the NPFL and endorsed by the Head, of the Com­petition Department for the head of operations, Dr. Sunday Obaseki, stat­ed that the unavailabili­ty of the stadium for the match due to the fact that it would be hosting a CAF Confederation Cup, first leg, quarterfinal match between Rivers United and Young Africans of Tanzania, necessitated the rescheduling of the match.
