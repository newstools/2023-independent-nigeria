ABUJA – The National Population Commission(NPC) has appealed to the political class to have an attitudinal change and desist from politicising the 2023 Population and Housing Census. A statement on Saturday issued by Dr. Isiaka Yahaya, Director, Public Affairs in NPC, explained that political class and all Nigerians should rather see census data for its fundamental purpose as a tool for development planning. In its Eid El Fitr message to the Muslim Ummah, the NPC prayed for peace, unity and progress as a catalyst for socio-economic development in Nigeria. The Commission also called on the Muslim faithful to imbibe the core values and uphold the vital lessons of Ramadan including love, piety, generosity, sacrifice, perseverance, peaceful coexistence and justice which the holy month teaches, to guide their relations with fellow human beings. “These traits should be a lifetime habit that should outlive the limited period during which Ramadan fasting was observed. “The Commission also urges Muslim leaders to use the occasion of this celebration to sensitise and mobilise the masses to get involved and support the conduct of the 2023 Population and Housing Census. “The Commission is in the final stage of preparations to deliver to the country its first fully digital Population and Housing Census that will be credible and acceptable to all.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “Nigeria’s 2023 Census will be fully digital and will be conducted in accordance with the United Nations Principles and Recommendations for the 2020 Programme on Population and Housing Censuses.
