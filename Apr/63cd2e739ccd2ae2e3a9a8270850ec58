The newly inaugurated Board Chairman of the Abuja Property Development Company’s (APDC) Alh Idris Malagi has pledged to increase profits for the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) while achieving the organization’s goals. Malagi hinted that the organization would use cutting-edge strategies to increase sales. He, however, mentioned several of the projects the business will be working on when he spoke with journalists shortly after his inauguration, which include launching the Centenary City project, building district hospitals, new hotels, and conference facilities, among other projects. He claimed that the initial approval for these projects, some of which, he claimed, are currently going through regulatory processes, has already been provided by the FCT minister. He further stated that: “As soon as those ones are done, we are already identifying those to help us in achieving those projects. We’ll be meeting with them and very soon we’ll make our roadmap known to the public.” Malagi, who is returning for a second term as chairman of the APDC Board, added that the company has successfully settled most of its financial burden in his first tenure, and so will focus on stabilising and growing the company going forward. “The primary thing is we need to stabilize and grow the company first. I want to take you back when we came here. The company was really in a very bad shape. Owing so many contractors and other people. But I am glad to say that all that is passed.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “During the first tenure, we were able to bring back the company to its profitability. Now we can say that APDC is not owing anybody, as it is standing on its feet and it is growing. As you can see, we are standing in the conference facility of the newly built headquarter. When we came in, it was just carcass. But now it completely built as you can see very beautifully designed. So in terms of revenue, so much will come but for now its to grow on what we have met on ground”, he stated.
