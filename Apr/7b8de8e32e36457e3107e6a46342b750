A former lawmaker, Shehu Sani, has revealed why the Federal Government postponed the 2023 national census. According to him, the federal government passed the buck to the President-elect, Bola Tinubu, because it could not fund the census, which is estimated to cost about $1.8 billion. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the postponement of the 2023 Population and Housing Census. Buhari said a new date would be determined by the incoming administration. Reacting to this, Sani tweeted, “The simple fact is that the FG doesn’t have $1.8 billion for the Census and now shifted the Wahala to Asiwaju.”
