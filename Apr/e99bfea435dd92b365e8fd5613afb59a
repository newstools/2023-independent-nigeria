ABUJA  – Yusuf Gadgi, who rep­resents Pankshin/Kan­ke/ Federal Constituency of Plateau State, has an­nounced that a political support group, South East­ern Democratic Union, is behind him in his bid to become speaker of the 10th Assembly of the House of Representatives, adding that he possesses the ca­pability and expertise re­quired to hold the office. Gagdi has distinguished himself by his track record of performance in key legis­lative duties and constituen­cy projects over the last four years of his time in the House of Representatives, according to a statement from the group signed by its Secretary Gener­al, Dr. Emma Onwuatuegwu. It, therefore, appealed to all stakeholders to support him to become the next speaker of the House of Representatives in order to deliver good gov­ernance and development to Nigerians. The group said: ‘’Gagdi is the youngest candidate in this contest so far. He is in his 40s but understands the legisla­ture. In his first and only term in the House of Representa­tives, six bills that he spon­sored or co-sponsored became law, signed by the president. “This has never happened since 1999 and this is his first and only term as a federal lawmaker. He sponsored or co-sponsored 18 bills altogeth­er and 6 were passed into law in a parliament that it takes an average of two and half years to pass a single bill. That is evidence of his understand­ing of the legislature and how to make parliament work. ‘’He is a very effective con­stituency operator. The proj­ects and empowerment he has done for his constituents place him high above every other member of the House, except for Speaker Gbajabiamila. He has touched lives of the youths, elderly and women in many ways including edu­cation sponsorship and water provision. ‘’He has excelled in his pri­mary function of lawmaking, in the function of advocacy, he has done well and in the unique function of constit­uency projects, he has also performed credibly.’’‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
