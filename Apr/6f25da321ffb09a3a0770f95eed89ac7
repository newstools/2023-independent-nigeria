ABUJA  – A Civil Society Organ­isation, under the auspices of Partner for Electoral Re­form, has cautioned Nigerians against allowing politicians to use their propaganda machines to drive a narrative that paints the just-concluded 2023 gener­al elections as the worst in the country’s history. Convener of the group, Mr. Ezenwa Nwagwu at an interac­tive session with journalists, in Abuja, Friday, said most of the commentary after the election has been from a position of propaganda, and in most cases founded on ignorance of histo­ry and ignorance of the process of election. He alleged that the target by the politicians is to criminalise INEC, and make it look weak, but urged Nigerians “to save the institutions and protect them.” “I’m just saying that the country needs to be nuanced in the way it engages in elections. And it must engage elections from an informed point of view. So that partisan interests do not overshadow the commentary,” he said. Nwangwu admitted that there was violence, suppression of votes during the election, but said it would be unfair to use violence in a few polling units to judge the entire process that happened in 176, 000 polling units. He said, “it is important that Nigerians who are knowledge­able about the electoral process put this narrative out and make the world know that 2023 was not Armageddon. It was not a disaster. INEC performed cred­itably up to the point where that challenge came. Where that challenge came from, time will expose it.” Nwangwa said the BVAS machine was still a game changer in the election and most politicians especially those who could not rig who are not pleased with the reforms in­troduced by INEC.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He recalled that there was a time in the country’s histo­ry when election results were written in hotel rooms.
