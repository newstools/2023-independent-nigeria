The youth wing of Labour Party on Sunday issued a terse warning to persons calling for the arrest of the party’s presidential candidate in the 2023 elections, Peter Obi. At a press conference in Owerri, Imo State, the National Youth Leader, Prince Kennedy Ahanotu, claimed that instead of Obi, the All Progressive Congress (APC), was engaged in violence and incendiary ethnic remarks, as he cited the attacks on Igbos in Lagos State. Insisting that the state was the stronghold of the governing party’s presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, Ahanotu recalled that no Yoruba or Hausa man was attacked in Anambra, the home state of Obi during the presidential election, as he stressed that a Yoruba man won a House of Assembly seat in Abia State. He equally wondered why those who were declared winner in a poll, rather than celebrating, should be calling for the arrest of those they snatched their mandate. The LP national youth leader who was flanked by other youth leaders, said Obi engaged in modest campaign anchored on competence and strength of character. He added that the Labour Party presidential candidate and the party have continued to be law-abiding in the pursuit of the recovery of their mandate. This is as he queried the rationale behind calling for the arrest of Obi, while those who stoked violence walk free.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Ahanotu called on security agents to rise to their responsibility and stop the attacks on the Igbo in Lagos. POLL The youths passed vote of confidence on the National Chairman of the party, Julius Abure, dismissing those calling for his suspension as hirelings of enemies. On the House of Assembly election in Imo State, where APC candidates were declared winners of the entire constituencies, Ahanotu underscored that if constituted with only APC members, the incoming assembly will be a lame duck of the executive and not a parliament.
