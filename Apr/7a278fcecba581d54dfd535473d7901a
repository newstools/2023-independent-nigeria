ENUGU – The Governor-elect of Enugu State, Dr. Peter Mbah, has bemoaned the death of a political stalwart and former gubernatorial aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), ahead of the 2023 general elections, Engr Dons Udeh, describing it as heartbreaking and condemnable. It is recalled that Udeh, whose lifeless body was found in the 9th Mile area of Enugu on Wednesday, was reported missing a few days ago. Engr Udeh was at various times a State Commissioner; Federal Commissioner of the Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC; board member of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA); State Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); Special Adviser to the Governor, and most recently a member of the State PDP Campaign Council, amongst others. Reacting to the development, Dr. Mbah, in a statement by the head of his media office, Dan Nwomeh, expressed deep grief and sadness over the loss, noting that Udeh had served the state and the nation creditably in several capacities. “I received with a deep sense of loss the news of the death of Engr. Dons Udeh, an illustrious son of Enugu State. He was a political associate, a true Waawa son, and patriot, who gave his best in the service of Enugu State, the nation, and humanity at large. “The circumstances of his death make it even more painful. It is horrendous, unacceptable, most condemnable, and must never go unpunished. I, therefore, urge the security agencies to do everything within their powers to unravel the killers and bring them to book”. While expressing heartfelt condolences to the family of the late political stalwart and the entire people of Ozalla whom he served notably as the President General of their apex development union, Dr. Mbah also prayed to God to grant them the inner strength to bear the irreparable loss. He equally prayed for the peaceful repose of the soul of the deceased.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
