The Edo State Government has commenced the recruit­ment process for the employ­ment of over 700 healthcare practitioners to strengthen its primary healthcare system in line with ongoing reforms in the health sector by the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led adminis­tration. The Executive Secretary, Edo State Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Omo­sigho Izedonmwen, while ad­dressing journalists during the computer-based test held at the Edo State Secretariat Complex, Benin City, said about 720 pro­fessionals including doctors, nurses, community extension workers, and administrators, among others, will be recruited. He said, “We are bringing onboard about 720 people into the primary healthcare develop­ment agency. The recruitment cuts across the full spectrum of the staffing crew, including doctors, nurses, community extension workers, and admin­istrators, among others. “This computer-based test is the first stage of the recruitment process. As part of the criteria, they must be computer literate because the primary healthcare development agency will be driven by technology.” The Executive Secretary add­ed, “Those who beat the thresh­old will, one week from now, go for an oral interview and will be placed in at most 3 weeks’ time. So, the target is to get them on board towards the end of April.”
