Honourable Debo Ologunagba, the National Publicity Secretary of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), has affirmed that it would be wrong for the Supreme Court to rule that winner of Nigerian presidency does not require 25 percent of votes from the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to be declared winner. This is even as the main opposition party’s presidential candidate in the last general election, Atiku Abubakar, did not meet that requirement ahead of the formal declaration by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) winner of the election held on February 25, 2023. Ologunagba while in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT on the position of the party regarding that part of the reasons (FCT 25 percent) Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) is challenging the declaration of Tinubu as the president-elect, said the apex court should not be expected to go against what it has ruled before, explaining that the AND inserted into that Section 34 of the constitution was was conjunctive and not disjunctive as the Supreme Court had earlier ruled. “The AND is a conductive and INEC has ruled on this before. To be conjunctive means to be a PLUS. “On this note and in my own view, it is compulsory to score 25 percent of votes in the FCT to be declared winner and I am not expecting the Supreme Court not to rule on this. “The matter will soon come before them and I am expecting that they not only interpret this well but ensure that they make Nigerians to know that Justice has been served given that they are being watched and monitored. “The whole world is looking at us; they have been there before and I am expecting them to toe the path they had tied before in ruling that the AND is conjunctive,” he said.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Meanwhile, if that position is held by both the tribunal and the Supreme Court, it will automatically knock out both Atiku and the president-elect because both hitherto gladiators failed to score at least 25 percent votes in the nation’s seat of power.
