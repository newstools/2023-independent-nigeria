Zenith Bank Plc has announced its unaudited results for the first quarter ending 31st March 2023, with an exceptional double-dig­it growth of 41% in gross earn­ings, increasing from N191.5 billion in Q1 2022 to N270 billion in Q1 2023. The unaudited statement of account submitted to the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) on Friday, 28th April 2023, indicated that the significant double-dig­it growth in the topline also boosted the bottom line, with the Group experiencing an im­pressive 27% year-on-year (YoY) increase in Profit before Tax (PBT), rising from N68 billion in Q1 2022 to N86.6 billion in Q1 2023. Profit After Tax (PAT) also grew by 13% from N58.2 billion to N66 billion during the same period. The growth in the topline was propelled by substantial increases in both interest in­come and non-interest income. Interest income surged by 52% from N126.4 billion in Q1 2022 to N191.6 billion in Q1 2023, while non-interest income expanded by 27% from N57.2 billion to N72.8 billion. The growth in interest in­come can be attributed to the impact of risk asset repricing, while the increase in non-in­terest income primarily result­ed from loan recoveries and foreign currency revaluation gains. Regarding efficiency, the cost-to-income ratio improved from 55% to 53.4% in the cur­rent period, supported by a bol­stered income line. The cost of risk also moder­ated from 0.8% to 0.7% during the same period due to an en­larged loan book. However, the cost of funding doubled YoY from 1.3% in Q1 2022 to 2.7% in Q1 2023, owing to a considerable spike in inter­est rates between both periods as interest expense grew from N25.8 billion in Q1 2022 to N70.8 billion in Q1 2023.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ This impacted the net in­terest margin (NIM), which re­duced from 7.3% to 6.9% over the same period. POLL Total assets expanded by 9% from N12.29 trillion in De­cember 2022 to N13.36 trillion in March 2023, primarily driven by growth in customer deposits and other funding sources, such as borrowings. Customer deposits increased by 2% from N8.98 trillion in De­cember 2022 to N9.14 trillion in March 2023. Loans and advances also experienced marginal growth of 1% from N4.12 trillion in December 2022 to N4.15 trillion in March 2023 as customers continued to adjust to the full impact of higher rates on risk assets. Both the capital adequacy and liquidity ratios remained robust at 19.5% and 72%, re­spectively, with both prudential ratios comfortably exceeding regulatory thresholds. In 2023, the Group will main­tain its focus on sustainable growth across all business seg­ments as it restructures into a holding company, introduces new verticals to its businesses, and expands into new frontiers. Zenith Bank’s consistent record of outstanding perfor­mance has garnered numerous accolades for the brand, includ­ing being acknowledged as the Number One Bank in Nigeria by Tier-1 Capital for the 13th consecutive year in the 2022 Top 1000 World Banks Ranking pub­lished by The Banker Magazine.
