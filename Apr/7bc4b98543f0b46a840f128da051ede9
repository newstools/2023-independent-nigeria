The president of the Ni­geria Wrestling Federa­tion (NWF), Dr. Daniel Igali has said that he is positive of a good out­ing in the Africa Wres­tling Championship in Tunisia from May 15 to 21. Igali gave the hint at the closing ceremony of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) Na­tional team trials at the dynamite theatre of wres­tling in Yenagoa, Bayelsa state. He said he was elated with the level of compe­tition he witnessed in the two-day event, express­ing optimism that Ni­gerian wrestlers would distinguish themselves at the championship. The Commissioner explained that with the achievement recorded in wrestling in the last 10 years, he is targeting a medal sweep in Tunisia, stating that no sport has done better than wres­tling in Nigeria. He noted that records in the wrestling federa­tion speak volumes for the federation and they are leaving nothing to chance to produce a five-star performance in Tu­nis, Tunisia. The Olympian as­serted that apart from the trial to produce athletes for the trip to the Northern African nation, wrestlers that would represent Nige­ria in 2028 were also discovered, saying that the grooming process has already commenced. Reflecting on the tal­ents discovered during the trial, Igali stressed that the future of wres­tling is bright in Nigeria describing the event as laudable.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
