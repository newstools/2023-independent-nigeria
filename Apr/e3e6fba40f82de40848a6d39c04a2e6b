José Mourinho insists contracts are ‘not the most important thing’ in football amid reports of a potential return to Chelsea in the summer. The Giallorossi boss is under contract at the Stadio Olimpico until June 2024, but his future at the club remains uncertain. When asked whether he plans to remain at Roma for the final year of his contract, Mourinho replied: “I don’t speak about my future with my friends or journalists. “Our CEO Berardi said a few months ago that I would have stayed, but it’s his interpretation of things and the same applies to [journalist Ivan] Zazzaroni. From a contract perspective, I have another year left, but contracts sometimes are not the most important thing.” Mourinho was speaking at a post-match press conference after a 3-0 win over Sampdoria on Sunday, which allowed the Giallorossi to reach Inter in the top four in Serie A. Zazzaroni wrote on Il Corriere dello Sport last week that Mourinho had decided to remain at Roma, but the Special One’s latest claims mean he hasn’t yet made a decision over his future in the Capital. Multiple reports in Italy claim Mourinho expects more investments in the summer transfer window to remain at the club.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The 60-year-old is reportedly among the candidates to take over at Chelsea next season and several fans have been calling for his appointment on social media.
