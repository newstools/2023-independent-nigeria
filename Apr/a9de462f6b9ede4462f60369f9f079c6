BENIN  – The Chairman of the Benin Port Project, Greg Ogbeifun, has assured that the 10 Edo indigenes undergoing studies under the Nigerian Seafarers Development Programme (NSDP) scholarship scheme will be engaged as pioneer staff of the Benin Port. In a statement, Ogbeifun said the Edo indigenes are making progress in their studies. He noted that a major ad­vantage of the port project is the opportunity it presents to build local capacity of Edo youths to participate actively in the maritime sector. The young Edo indigenes are part of other Nigerian stu­dents on fully funded scholar­ships in Greece and India by Nigerian Maritime Admin­istration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) studying maritime related courses. The port project is jointly being executed by the Edo State Government and the Fed­eral Government through the Nigeria Port Authority (NPA). The Minister of Transpor­tation had set up the Project Steering Committee (PSC) and Project Delivery Team (PDT) to ensure realisation of the Benin Port Project un­der a Public-Private Partner­ship (PPP) arrangement, as already approved by the Fed­eral Government of Nigeria through the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Com­mission (ICRC). The port is a legacy proj­ect of the Governor Godwin Obaseki administration, which aims to contribute to the development of both the maritime and agricultural sectors, creating massive em­ployment opportunities.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
