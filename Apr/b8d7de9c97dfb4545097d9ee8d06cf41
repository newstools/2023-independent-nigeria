LOKOJA  – The Vice Chancellor, Prince Abu­bakar Audu University Anyigba (PAAUA), Kogi State, Professor Marietu Ohunene Tenuche, has said that no amount of blackmail and falsehood targeted at the in­stitution by the alumni associa­tion can derail her from achiev­ing the development agenda set for the institution. This is just as she said that the allegations of fraud purport­edly levelled against her by the alumni association was farther from the truth, as the suit was in­stituted by a rival faction against the others . Professor Tenuche made the clarification in a world press con­ference held at the university au­ditorium, Anyigba in Kogi State. The VC said the attention of the university was drawn to pub­lications by some news platforms with derogatory headlines: “Fe­male vice chancellor dragged to court over N31m fraud,” the story she considered to be false, mali­cious with imputation to tarnish her image and cause distraction to the mission and vision of her administration for the ivory tower. She explained that contrary to the purpose of alumni associ­ations, the world over, the Kogi State University management has been, for many years, dealing with a few individuals, who, rath­er than seek to pursue the ideals of an alumni association, resort­ed to devising ways of milking the university dry, at all cost. According to her, to set the records straight, the general public should be informed that Suit No.: AYHC/03/2023 pending before the Kogi State High Court of Justice, sitting in Anyigba, has no link whatsoever, with an alle­gation of fraud against the office and person of the vice chancellor of the university. She added that it was no lon­ger news that the alumni asso­ciation of Kogi State University has been enmeshed in leadership crises for years, with two factions laying claim to legitimacy as na­tional executives of the Associ­ation.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “The crises have resulted in legal action and counter legal actions in court. While the vari­ous actions are still pending, one of the factions, championed by two individuals, in particular, approached the university on several occasions, demanding funds and that they be invited to attend meetings of the Govern­ing Council of the university, on the basis that they are the legally elected national executives of the University Alumni Association.”
