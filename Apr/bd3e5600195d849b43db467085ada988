Arsenal are preparing a new bid for Wolves winger Pedro Neto after installing him as one of their top targets last year, according to the latest reports. Neto was the subject of serious interest from Arsenal last summer. However, Wolves managed to keep hold of the Portugal international after setting a high asking price. This year, though, Arsenal are fancying their chances of getting a better deal. According to a report from Football Transfers, Arsenal are reviving their interest in Neto. Since he has only started 10 Premier League matches this season either side of an ankle injury, they believe he might be available for a lower sum than last year. (SOURCE: Team Talk)
