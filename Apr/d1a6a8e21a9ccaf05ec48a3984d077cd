Manchester United have enjoyed a successful season to date, but their Europa League exit has put a downer on the campaign. United were beaten 3-0 by Sevilla in their quarter-final second leg, and fans have taken to social media to vent their frustrations. Goals from Youssef En-Nesyri and Loic Bade saw Erik Ten Hag’s side crash out of the competition. It was a performance filled with errors and mistakes that Sevilla capitalised on to send them through to the semi-finals. United have already won the Carabao Cup, and could lift the FA Cup after securing a top-four finish in the Premier League. However, some fans have had enough of certain players this season, and have stated what the club should do on Twitter. One supporter said that captain Harry Maguire, who made a mistake for the first goal, should depart: “Maguire is the first name on the sell list. He needs to leave.” A second added: “Jadon Sancho has got to be sold, he is not good enough and he is a coward on the pitch, with all that ability & technique quality, his lack of impact is shameful!” POLL After causing an error in the lead-up to the third goal, another believes the club shouldn’t extend David de Gea’s stay: “De Gea: never renew and let him leave.” Bruno Fernandes was absent from the defeat due to suspension, and one fan believes that his influence on the side is underrated. They said: “United fans really should start appreciating Bruno Fernandes more. For the last three years, it’s so shamelessly obvious when he’s not on the pitch.” Despite their Europa League exit, United still have the chance to win another piece of silverware in Ten Hag’s impressive debut campaign. They face Brighton in the FA Cup semi-finals on Sunday, their second trip to Wembley this season. United are also on course to qualify for the Champions League, but Thursday’s defeat could still sting for many fans in the coming weeks. (SOURCE: TalkSPORT)
