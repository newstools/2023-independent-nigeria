Chad’s government ordered the German ambassador, Gordon Kricke, to leave the country within 48 hours, it said in a statement on Friday, without giving a specific reason for the expulsion. “This decision of the government is motivated by the discourteous attitude and the non-respect of diplomatic customs,” the country’s Communication Ministry said on Twitter, Reuters reported. “We have not been officially contacted,” a source at the German Embassy told AFP on condition of anonymity, who said he had heard the news via social media. Kricke has previously served as a diplomat in Niger, Angola and the Philippines. He was also a special representative for Germany in the unstable Sahel. A government source told AFP, on condition of anonymity, that Kricke was seen as “interfering too much” in the governance of the country and making divisive remarks. He had been warned on several occasions, the source added.
