US President Joe Biden said Monday he plans to run for re-election in 2024 but stopped short of officially launching his campaign. “I plan on running… but we’re not prepared to announce it yet,” Biden said during an interview with the Today television morning program’s longtime weatherman Al Roker. Biden, 80, is already the oldest person to have assumed the American presidency and would be 82 by the time he would be inaugurated for a second term. The president has long insisted that he intends to run for office again, and multiple news outlets have reported that he has said behind closed doors that he will, in fact, follow through on his ambitions. But the timeline for that announcement has repeatedly slipped. CNN reported on Friday that Biden has told officials that he will run. “I am definitely running,” he recently told one individual, the unnamed person told CNN. Should he announce, Biden will trail former President Donald Trump who announced a Republican White House run in November amid several criminal investigations across a breadth of issues.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
