Senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa on Sunday in Akure, the Ondo State capital, declared that God has no interest in politics of the world. He said this was in contrary to the views of some Christian leaders who took side with politicians in the just concluded general elections in Nigeria. According to the cleric, “Prior to the just-concluded presidential election, some religious leaders had turned their pulpits to campaign platforms to announce their preferred candidates and urged Nigerians to vote for them.” He warned that ministers of God should desist from dragging the name of God through the mud by turning their pulpits to campaign rosltrums. Giwa said: “The beautiful one is not yet born when it comes to politics. “Gone were the days when God would pick leaders for the nations of the world. Nowadays, they force themselves on the people by hook or by crook. Do you think our God supports that process? No “Let me tell you this; the beautiful one is not yet born. You killed, manipulated your way to power and you said God made you the leader. No sir, impossible!‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “God’s Spirit lives in a good environment, not an environment surrounded by the wicked people of the world. POLL “The current politics is meant for those who don’t fear God. They lie, kill and manipulate results in their favour. At the same time, you see these people in churches, mosques praying and giving God the glory. “Nobody can manipulate God, He is too big to be manipulated. The current political leaders don’t know God, they are far away from Him. “Please, stop dragging God’s name into politics because His Spirit dwells in a descent environment.”
