Ahead of the May 29 date for the inauguration of the president-elect Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Governor Babajide Sanwoolu, a  group in APC, Asiwaju Support Moving Train (ASMT) has recommended Honourable Tunji Bello, the Lagos State Commissioner For Environment And Water Resources, for a Federal appointment. The group premised its recommendation on the prominent roles played by  Honourable Bello in the campaign activities that led to the victories of  Asiwaju Tinubu and Governor Sanwoolu at the polls. Commending these roles in a letter signed by its Director General, Olaide Oladeebo and transmitted to the commissioner, the group noted that the job creation programmes embarked upon by the Ministry of Environment And Water Resources really endeared thousands of Lagos voters to the All Progressive Congress (APC) as a party. “Worthy of note were the job creation initiatives of your Ministry that saw hundreds of youth in all the Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) across the state being gainfully employed. ” It is gratifying to note that many of these young men and women employed by your ministry were once urchins who engaged in nefarious activities that posed threat to the security and peace of the neighbourhood. “Undoubtedly, the job creations have put food on the table for these employees and their dependents, thus restoring hopes to many homes that would have been without breadwinners. ” the group stressed. ASMT said Bello had done enough to retain his relevance in the scheme of things at the state level but called on the party leadership to consider him for a higher office at the federal level. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ POLL ” Truth be told, the success we attained at the polls would not have been possible without the unflinching support of committed leaders like you in the party” ASMT added.
