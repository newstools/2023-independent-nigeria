ENUGU – The Ohanaeze Ndigbo is shocked by the death of Mrs. Ifeoma Orji Uzor Kalu, the wife of the Chief Whip of the Senate and former Governor of Abia State, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu. Dr. Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia, National Publicity Secretary, Ohaneze Ndigbo in a statement said “Although death is an inevitable reality for all mortals, it is the reminisces that we shall forever miss her beauty, charm, warmth, care, passion and the invaluable services she rendered to humanity while alive that throw us into deep mourning. “The former First Lady of Abia State, Mrs Ifeoma Orji Uzor Kalu has been described variously as a kind-hearted, disciplined, diligent, brilliant, wholesome and virtuous woman of substance;  a physician whose skill and expertise found full expression in the United States of America. It is therefore painful that death will strike at the age she should enjoy the rewards of her services to mankind. “The Chairman, Council of Elders, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Dr. Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, CFR (Ahaejiagamba) and indeed all the organs of Ohanaeze Ndigbo share this moment of grief with our brother and son, Orji Uzor. “While we send our condolences to the Distinguished Senator, the children and the extended family we also pray to the Almighty to grant the soul of Mrs Ifeoma Orji Uzor Kalu an eternal rest in his bosom,” he said.
