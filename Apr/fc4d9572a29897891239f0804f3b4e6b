E IKEME OMENAZU According to Apostle Dr. Kanayo Success Uchime, President, Kingdom Missions Outreach, with headquarters in Abakiliki, Ebonyi State, Easter, which Christendom observe today, is the period Christians all over the world celebrate the death, burial and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. According to Uchime, a renowned missionary, Easter should be celebrated by Christians because Christ’s death on the cross of Calvary, his burial and subsequent resurrection are biblical facts that cannot be disputed. He said: “Christ died for our sins and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures (1 Cor. 15:3,4). Easter represents Jesus’ victory over death and the eternal hope and redemption of Christians.” He agreed that the celebration of Easter should be taken seriously by Christians, because “It is so important and all of Christianity revolves around it. “This is so because, if Jesus had not died for the sins of the world, and if He had not risen from death, then, the entire hope of Christians is based upon nothing, but lies and falsehood. “If Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and our faith is also empty (1 Cor. 15:14). Therefore, Christ’s resurrection becomes the anchor of the Christian faith.” ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
