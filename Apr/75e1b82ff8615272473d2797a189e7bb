ABUJA –  As the race for a Senate President for the 10th National Assembly gathers momentum, a pro-democracy initiative, APC Integrity Group, has called on the All Progressives Congress to crown Senator Mohammed Sani Musa (APC Niger East) the new Deputy Senate President (DSP) for his “strong commitment to the progress and development of the party”. In a statement Sunday in Abuja, the group explained that the Niger East legislature has carried out numerous assignments for the party, including “funding party activities and other logistical support at the local, state and national levels”. It equally cautioned that the new DSP should be one who understands the vision of the APC and can “point others to such direction”, something it said Senate Sani has done for the party at all levels in Niger State. The document made available to Daily Independent and signed by the duo of Dawu Mohammed (Coordinator) and Chisom Nwakanma (Secretary), urged the party to among others, “consider retaining its leadership voice at the Senate, and as such, take into mind the services and efforts made” by the North Central Zone. This is as it warned the ruling party not to be in “a hurry to forget the inglorious days of in-fighting between the Eighth Assembly and the presidency which in many ways affected the government’s provision of the dividends of democracy to the people”, it urged that the Niger East Lawmaker must be given the opportunity to add value to the leadership of the Upper Chamber. It reads in part, “As the Ninth National Assembly enters its twilight in preparation for the resumption of the 10th Assembly, the need for a Senate that would give necessary stimulus for the executive to provide Nigerians with quality leadership is what should be paramount in the mind of everyone, especially the leaders of our Dear party, All Progressives Congress (APC). “The Ninth Assembly and a list of patriotic lawmakers, of who is Senator Mohammed Sani Musa (313), APC Niger East, seeing the damage done to the nation by the rancorous relationship between the executive and the 8th Assembly insisted that such would not be allowed to repeat itself.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The rest is history as we all witnessed the smooth relationship between both arms of government, thus, the successes recorded by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration in the area of infrastructural development, security, agriculture, revitalization of railway transportation, revamping of marine transport, and others too numerous to mention”. POLL “As a committed APC group which has severally defended the party at our various endeavours, we have studied the political calculations and strongly support the reports of our party zoning the senate principal of offices “We ask the esteemed APC National Chairman, Distinguished Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and the Board of Trustee (BOT) of our great party, alongside the National Working Committee (NWC) to consider loyalty to the party, legislative ingenuity, astute leadership qualities, and a person who is able to work with the Senate President (SP), as a Deputy Senate President (DSP), to carry all 109 Senators along for a peaceful, effective and efficient legislative service delivery for the country. “Senator Musa’s ingenuity at using legislative machinery to solve national issues such as electoral matters is seen in a proposal that birthed the card reader used by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), in previous elections. “The card reader no doubt was a major advancement in electioneering in Nigeria. “To this end we stress that no other person best fits this description than Senator Musa who has sponsored a total of 26 Bills, of the 21 percent total legislations sponsored by North Central Senators in the Ninth Assembly. “We have followed the antecedents of Senator Musa and have come to the conclusion that with current trend, calibre of new, young and outspoken politicians who are coming on board from the opposition parties, especially the PDP and LP, a Senator Musa as DSP would be of immense benefit to our party at the National Assembly level. “It is also on record that Senator Musa, who has remained a solid rock for our great party in Niger state, contributed immensely to our resounding victory in the state, as he hosted several campaign rallies for our candidates not only in his senatorial district, but the state in general. “Also, we at the APC Integrity Group having followed his steps at the outgoing Ninth Senate sees Senator Musa as a great asset that our great party needs not only to have our way in the Upper Chamber of the National Assembly, but to win other lawmakers to our side. “It is our belief that though we have won the presidential election and secured the majority at both the Senate and House of Representatives, it is only when we get it right with the right leadership at the 10th Assembly that we can sustain the momentum we have been able to create across the nation. A stitch in time saves nine,” it added.
