LAGOS – The nation’s highest soccer governing body, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has said that it would in the next month constitute boards for the Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) and the other league governing bodies. The other bodies are: the Nigeria National League (NNL), the Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL) and the Nigeria Nationwide League One (NLO). In a communique released after its meeting on Monday in Abuja, the NFF said it would do this as enshrined in the Statutes. The Board also charged the Under-17 Boys’ National Team (Golden Eaglets) to deploy its best efforts in overcoming all before it to win the Africa U17 Cup of Nations taking place in Algeria between April 29 and May 19, and in the process earning a ticket to the FIFA U17 World Cup finals taking place later this year. While asseverating that the bronze-medal performance of the U20 Boys, Flying Eagles at the Africa U20 Cup of Nations in Egypt was below-par, the Board exhorted the technical crew and the players to see it as a national duty to win the FIFA U20 World Cup for Nigeria when the tournament takes place in Argentina between May 20 and June 11. The Board expressed satisfaction with the new positive spirit and winning mentality in the camp of the senior women national team, Super Falcons, which has seen the team win its last three international matches. With the bigger picture of the biggest-ever FIFA Women’s World Cup competition coming up in Australia and New Zealand this summer in mind, the Board admonished the technical crew to work even harder to give confidence to the players that they can indeed stand their own against the world’s best. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Board stated that it will do even more to prepare the team for the big challenge with another grade A friendly match in Europe and a two-week camping in Australia before the kick-off of the tournament on July 20. POLL Genuinely disturbed by the vexed issue of agents and football merchants around the various National Teams and their debilitating effects on the performance of the teams over the past few years, the Board vowed to henceforth, mete out stiff sanctions to whoever is caught aiding or abetting, dealing, perpetrating or perpetuating the ignoble activities of these nefarious individuals no matter their roles, status or pedigree.
