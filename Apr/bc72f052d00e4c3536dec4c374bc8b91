Leeds lost a goal-scoring threat in its fight for English Premier League survival when Luis Sinisterra was ruled out for the remainder of the season Friday because of an ankle injury. The Colombia winger scored three goals in his last five appearances for relegation-threatened Leeds, which plays at Bournemouth on Sunday. Sinisterra was forced out of Tuesday’s 1-1 draw with Leicester just past the half-hour mark, shortly after he headed in Jack Harrison’s cross to give his team an early lead at Elland Road. “It’s something in his ankle, a ligament,” manager Javi Gracia said Friday. Leeds has lacked bite defensively in the absence of midfielder Tyler Adams (hamstring) and key defender Max Wober, who remains doubtful for the Bournemouth game. “It’s tough for us to lose key players. I prefer to not complain. I have enough players to compete better and try to work with them,” Gracia said. Crysencio Summerville came on for Sinisterra on Tuesday, but Gracia indicated 19-year-old winger Willy Gnonto would be in line for more minutes at Vitality Stadium.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Leeds, on a four-game winless skid, is one point above the relegation zone.
