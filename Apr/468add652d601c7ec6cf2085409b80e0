Chairman/Chief Execu­tive of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mo­hamed Buba Marwa (rtd) has approved the extension of the close of applications on its recruitment portal by a week to enable appli­cants having challenges submitting their applica­tions to take advantage of the additional days to com­plete the process. The online application portal was opened on Sunday 12th March and was originally scheduled to close on Saturday 8th April, but with the one-week extension, the por­tal will remain open till midnight on Monday 17th April. This will enable appli­cants who are yet to com­plete their application process to do so and those interested but yet to sign up to also take advantage of the extra days to fill their application on the portal.
