Popular Nigerian Evangelist and the President of the film production company, Mount Zion Faith Ministries and Mount Zion Television, Mike Bamiloye, has said many youths enter into marriage without knowledge about marriage. Lending his voice on marital trends among young couples, Bamiloye, who shared via his verified Instagram account, noted that youths entering into marriage are engrossed much more about the wedding than the marriage. “I am so afraid of the youths of this generation. Many are not prepared enough to enter into marriage. Many are very shallow in their knowledge of marriage. They prepare more for the wedding day than for marriage life. No deep studies on what marriage entails. “They are too hasty and not ready to sit down and learn the principles of marital life. Many ladies are not qualified to be wives even at 28. They can’t cook properly. They are used to fast foods at the eateries, and ice cream, Indomie and Spaghetti plus boiled eggs and Titus. They spend six months studying the wedding gowns and the accessories for the bridal trains.” He further stated that ladies now rush in and out of marriage. “Now, our young sisters are being taught how to walk out of marriage. Many of them are rushing in and they are being taught how to rush out of It when things are not working out as expected,” Bamiloye said.
