The Ogun State government has advised residents and or­ganisations in the state to be conscious of their health and maintain proper hygiene in their homes and the commu­nity at large. Commissioner for Health, Dr. Tomi Coker, gave the ad­vice during a road-walk and a visit to the Alake’s Palace in Abeokuta to commemorate the Year 2023 World Health Day and the 75th Anniversary of World Health Organisation (WHO), with the theme: “Health for All’.’ He noted that the essence of the walk was to create aware­ness and educate the people on various diseases and ailments, and how to prevent them. Represented by the Perma­nent Secretary, Ministry of Health, Dr. Kayode Oladeinde, Coker said; “The significance of the day is to create public awareness on how people can take proper care of themselves. We also want to educate them on some health related issues, how to identify them and what to do when they have these is­sues. We want to tell them to be conscious of their health and go to the hospital when they are sick”. Also speaking, the Execu­tive Secretary, Primary Health Care Development Board, Dr. Elijah Ogunsola, stated that the WHO recognises the roles of traditional institutions and leaders in the health of the peo­ple, hence the visit to the Pal­ace, appreciating the efforts of the organization in providing interventions to prevent killer diseases such as polio, measles, among others. Ogunsola, who said that the Prince Dapo Abiodun-led administration remained com­mitted to the overall wellbeing and health of the residents, stated that over 100 Primary Health Centers (PHCs) had been renovated across the state, and equipped with state of-the-art facilities, to ensure people have access to quality care, urging them to always patronise PHCs, to justify gov­ernment’s huge investment in the sector.
