ANDREW UTULU LAGOS The Customs Area Controller (CAC), Seme border Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Comptroller Dera Nnadi, has averred that upon resumption at the command, he pledged to adopt new strategies to boost, trade while enforcing the nation’s anti-smuggling laws along the Abidjan- Lagos Corridor (ALCO), in line with the ECOWAS protocols on the free movement of goods and persons. The Customs boss who assumed duty at the command two months and three weeks ago as the Customs Area Controller disclosed this during a press briefing on the first quarter performance of the command. The CAC also at this occasion, handed over $6 million seized by the command to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). He also handed over other seized items to other partner sister agencies. “I wish to once again welcome you to Seme Area Command, this time to brief you on the performance of the Command in the first quarter of the year 2023. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “It is exactly two months and two weeks today since I resumed duty in the Command as the Customs Area Controller. POLL “Upon my resumption, I pledged to adopt new strategies to boost trade while enforcing the nation’s anti-smuggling laws along the Abidjan Lagos Corridor (ALCO) in line with the ECOWAS protocols on the free movement of goods and persons. “I promised to encourage compliant traders along the corridor while enforcing the law against inflexible offenders who will wish to test our resolve. “In line with keeping to these promises, the Command has in the first quarter of 2023 facilitated the movement of ETLS: 425 Trucks with fees amounting to N314, 720, 938.71, 412 baggage declarations with duty amounting to N58, 844,382. “The items imported under this arrangement include food products and beverages produced within the sub-region.” For export, he said 1,243 trucks bearing 40,096.47 metric tons of made-in-Nigeria cargo declared on 165 Single Administrative Documents (SAD) with Free On Board (FOB) value of N4, 291,322,887.19 and National Export Supervision Scheme Fes of N21, 456,551.83K passed through the command. He added that during the same period in 2022, 3006 trucks bearing 116,053.9 metric tons of cargo with FOB value of N6, 597, 506, 993.28K with NESS Fee of N32, 989,006.16 was recorded. “Regrettably there is a shortfall in export to the tune of 75,000 metric tons of cargo due to competition between Dangote Cement and competitors in the cement market at Togo. Other sources of revenue for the Command are fees collected from the auction sales of seized items especially petroleum products and other perishable items. To this end, the Command generated a total of N350, 099,541.71 in the first quarter of 2023. “The above is N105,095,708.76 or 23.09 percent short of N455,195,250,.47 collected in the corresponding period in 2022. “The deficit could be attributed to a lull in activities during the cashless policy and the wait by the traders for the outcome of the general election. “Also recall that I had earlier informed you that the economic policy of the Republic of Benin which charges fees on goods in transit to Nigeria constitutes tariff barriers to trade along the corridor. “These affected the Commands revenue and need urgent review.” He said that one of the core mandates of the Service in Seme as elsewhere is trade facilitation, adding that the Command is conscious of its strategic location as the foremost frontier for trade and tourism in West and Central Africa, particularly the ECOWAS Trade Liberalization Scheme (ETLS) and the emerging African Continental Free Tade Area (AfCFTA). Nigeria has lots of potential in both trade regimes considering its GDP, population and industrial capacity which is the highest in the West and Central Africa sub-region and indeed Africa. “However, I wish to repeat as I had earlier mentioned in my previous interactions with the media that the major source of revenue of the Command (import/export) has not been enhanced since the opening of the land Borders as directed by the Federal Government of Nigeria as the traders are still bracing with the challenges of having been out of business for over two years. “Where few have embraced the reality of the circumstances, they have requested and appealed for a review of the process of obtaining approvals for re-exportation which requires that they go to Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget, and National Planning at Abuja for every application for re-exportation.” Speaking on the anti-smuggling and enforcement activities of the Command, Comptroller Nnadi said that realizing that a secured border would translate to more revenue even at the sea ports, Seme Command in the first quarter of 2023 has recorded milestones in its anti-smuggling operations. Some of the anti-smuggling landmarks by the Command include the seizure of fake $6m (Six Million) USD (the equivalent of N2.763 billion at an exchange rate of N460.52), which was handed over to the EFCC during the exercise. Also seized in the first quarter were 2, 242 bags of 50kg rice equivalent to 112,100 kg or four trailer loads of foreign parboiled rice with Duty Paid Value(DPV) of N72, 700, 480. 7, 587 by 30 liters of Premium Motor Spirit(PMS), the equivalent of 227,610 liters or seven tanker loads of PMS with Duty Paid Value (DPV) of N51, 075, 684; 550 pieces of donkey skin with DPV of N10, 689,504.
