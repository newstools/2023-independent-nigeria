LAGOS  – Golden Eaglets, Nduka Ugbade says the team is set on qualifying for FIFA U-17 World Cup at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying tourna­ment. Ugbade reiterated the team’s objective at the qualifying tour­nament, the Africa U-17 Cup of Nations, which gets under way on April 29 in Algeria. “We continue to work hard as we look forward to the championship in Algeria. Our objective has not changed; we go hard for the World Cup ticket and then we aim for the trophy. “Our first target is a ticket to the World Cup finals, and then we take things from there,” the Golden Eaglets coach said. “I have confidence in the squad we have been able to build, even as we are still utilizing ev­ery minute, every hour to tinker with what we have and see how it can get better,” he added. Nigeria has a rich history at the FIFA Under-17 World Cup, the Golden Eaglets are the most suc­cessful team in the tournament, winning it five times and Ugbade insists that the current team wants to emulate that success. The four teams that reach the semifinals of the Cup of Na­tions in Algeria will emerge as Africa’s representatives at the FIFA Under-17 World Cup.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
