ABUJA – A group, APC Youths Sentinel has asked the President -elect, Bola Tinubu, to lend his support to the aspiration of the Senate Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu, to emerge the President of the Senate. The group said that the former Abia State governor “is a tested and trusted colleague of Asiwaju who has displayed capacity to work for Nigerians and defend the cause of democracy just like the President-elect has been doing over the years”. It also cited example of how the President-elect and Senator Kalu as then governors of Lagos and Abia States were both reportedly persecuted for their stance against the aborted third-term agenda in 2006 but still went on to deliver their respective states to the opposition in 2007 despite moves by the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In a statement Tuesday in Abuja, and signed by the Northwest Coordinator of the group, Mohammed Abdulazeez, the group said, “while Tinubu delivered Lagos State to Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Kalu delivered Abia and Imo States to the newly formed Progressive People’s Alliance, PPA and came fourth in the presidential election of 2007”. “Since old dogs do not learn new tricks, the President-elect who is the most celebrated politician in Africa for spearheading the coalition that led to the crushing defeat of the then ruling party in 2015 which paved the way for the inauguration of our great party on May 29, 2015 needed a capable and trusted colleague with much hindsight, insight and foresights to lead the third arm of the government for the fast accomplishments of the agenda of the President-elect as the stakes are high. “We hold this to be true and self-evident in the past activities of the two great leaders. Therefore, there is no better time to enthrone a tested, reliable and proven democrat to chair and lead the 10th National Assembly than now”, it added.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
