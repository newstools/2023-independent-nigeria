LAGOS – Barely 24 hours to the kick-off of the TotalEnergies CAF Confederation’s Cup quarterfinal second leg tie in Dar es Salam, Rivers United’s team bus has been burgled and valuables worth thousands of dollars stolen. According to the Media Officer of the Pride of Rivers, Charles Mayuku, while completing their final training session ahead of the clash against Young Africans of Tanzania the players noticed that their team bus had been broken into and sprayed with toxic chemicals and a sum of $5,250 is missing. “On the ground to witness the horrible incident are CAF General Coordinator, Ali Nwebe (Uganda), CAF Head of Security, Jamil Bawalaggana Mpagi (Uganda) who have confirmed that a toxic chemical was sprayed in the bus”, Mayuku said. We gathered that Rivers United have already petitioned CAF as they await further action from the football ruling body. It will be recalled that Rivers United lost the first leg 2-0 in Port Harcourt.
