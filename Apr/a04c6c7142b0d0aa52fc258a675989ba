Premier League clubs are following developments with Croatia international midfielder Lovro Majer at Rennes. The 25-year old has made 49 appearances for club and country but is not starting as many games as he would like and Mail Sport understands he is open to a new challenge. Tottenham are regulars at Rennes as they follow the progress of wing-back Djed Spence during his loan spell yet sources in France say Arsenal and Liverpool are taking a greater interest in Majer’s situation. An intelligent, technical player Majer has vast experience and played for Croatia in the World Cup, scoring in their 4-1 win over Canada. He is highly valued by national team boss Zlatko Dalic and has scored twice in their Nations League campaign. Majer signed for Rennes from Dinamo Zagreb for £11million plus add ons in 2021 and he agreed a five year contract. He impressed in his first season with six goals and nine assists earning him a place in the French League team of the season. However, he has not been handed the same prominent role this campaign and is ready to leave.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Left-footed Majer is skilful, has quick feet plus an eye for a pass but Rennes would want £30m to sell him this summer. POLL He is represented by Niagara Sports Agency who also have Red Bull Leipzig’s Dani Olmo, Alvaro Morata of Atletico Madrid and Nacho at Real Madrid.
