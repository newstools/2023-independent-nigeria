Mikel Arteta’s talent ID is one of the best around, with Arsenal very much front and centre of the Premier League due to his ideologies. Once upon a time, the Spaniard claimed in a press conference that his project would go ‘bang’ and indeed, it has truly exploded into life this term. The Gunners are the runaway leaders in the top flight, besting Manchester City by eight points at present. Arteta has changed the culture of this great club in order to do so, bringing in players who will flood the dressing room with a positive and vibrant attitude. Long gone are the days of toxicity, that’s for sure. The likes of Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Jesus have brought a never-say-die mantra to north London, a belief and winner’s mentality that has filtered down right throughout the squad. That said, there is still some gutting left to do behind the scenes when the summer transfer window opens. Remarkably, Arsenal have sent the most players out on loan of any club in world football this term (25), with France seemingly a temporary home for many. However, for all the success a certain Folarin Balogun has enjoyed in Ligue 1, scoring 18 times this term, there is a Nuno Tavares and Nicolas Pepe.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ (SOURCE: Footballfancast)
