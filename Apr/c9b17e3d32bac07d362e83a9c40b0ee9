ABUJA  – Hon, Muktar Betara, the4 lawmaker representing Biu/Bayo/Shani and Kwaya Kusar Federal Constituency of Borno state, has enjoined Christians to imbibe the spir­it of selflessness and sacrific­es in all they do. He charged Christians and indeed Nigerians to em­ulate the lifestyle of Jesus Christ at all times. Quoting from 1 Peter 1:3, Betara said: “Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In His great mercy, He has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.” The Chairman of the House Committee on Appro­priation gave the charge in his Easter message to Christians and Nigerians in general. Betara in a statement signed by his media office said Easter signifies a “day of hope and joy, renewal and rebirth”. The top contender for the position of Speaker in the 10th National Assembly said Easter marks the end of lent, a period of renunciation and contemplation, adding that it commemorates Christ’s resurrection, a powerful reminder of God’s love and the promise of redemption for us all. “Today, we hold close the Easter message that nothing, not even death, can match the power of faith, hope, and love,” he said.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “And we remember Je­sus’ sacrifice and recommit ourselves to love God with all our hearts and to love our neighbours as ourselves, em­bracing His call to treat one another with compassion.” POLL The federal lawmaker de­scribed Easter Sunday as a chance to reflect on the con­tribution made by Christians across the country. “Easter Sunday gives us a chance to reflect on the considerable contribution Christian communities make to our national life, of­fering support and a sense of belonging to so many across the country. “Christianity and its val­ues of tolerance, compassion, and charity are embedded in our history and national fab­ric,” Betara said.
