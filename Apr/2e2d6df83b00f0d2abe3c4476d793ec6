Cerebral filmmaker, Femi Odugbemi has decried a lack of imagination in the stories that define Africa. In a post on his LinkedIn page, Odugbemi posited that stories of Africa usually reflect our worst instincts. According to him, we need to empower ourselves better with our stories as storytelling has always been our superpower. “Too many stories of Africa are reflections of our worst instincts and not enough imagination to foreshadow how we want to see our communities, our governance, our infrastructure and our future. We need to empower ourselves better with our stories. Storytelling has always been our superpower. “The village square, the markets, and the courtyards were spaces filled with folklore. These stories were always deliberately crafted to offer guidance and insight that shape the future of our communities and modified behaviour. They invented heroes and told tales of uncommon courage and selfless sacrifice in service of the community. “They fostered tribal pride with poetry and songs that detailed the history of a thousand sojourns and valiant progenitors. They created realms of metaphysical existence where forebears translated into unseen protectors and guardians of the tribe,” he wrote. According to Odugbemi who is a member of the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (IATAS), African stories built into every story a future reputation and the sustenance of the peace and prosperity of their tribes and were conscious of always choosing the future they desired by imbibing it in the imagination of their audience today. He further stated that African storytellers have to be far more deliberate and conscious about the images they leave in the subconscious of our audiences about what is ‘Africa.’ ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “Because what we imagine and story-sell becomes our reality in the fullness of time,” he added.
