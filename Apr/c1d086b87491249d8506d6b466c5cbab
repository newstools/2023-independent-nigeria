Andre Onana could be on his way out of Inter after just one season at San Siro, as interest from the Premier League continues to ramp up according to reports in Italy. For several months already, the Cameroonian international has been linked with a move to join Todd Boehly’s cash-splashing Chelsea in the upcoming summer transfer window. As reported by La Gazzetta dello Sport, Chelsea’s interest is serious and representatives from the West Londoners and the Nerazzurri could soon meet in Milan to further discuss a potential transfer. According to the report, Inter’s intention is to ask for a €40 million net payment to acquire Onana, who still has four remaining years on the five-year deal he signed in July 2022. Onana joined the Champions League semi-finalists on a free transfer upon the expiry of his contract with Ajax at the end of June last year. It is widely understood that Chelsea could be in the market for a goalkeeper given that Edouard Mendy has been largely out of favour this season and Kepa Arrizabalaga’s future at Stamford Bridge has seemed to be drawing to a close in every recent transfer window. In the event that Onana does depart in the summer, the first choice of replacements would be Empoli’s Guglielmo Vicario ahead of Marco Carnesecchi, currently on loan at Cremonese from Atalanta.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
