International Breweries Plc, one of the world’s largest beer maker with over 500 beer brands, has recorded double-digit revenue growth for the full year ended December 31, 2022. The company’s net revenue for the year total grew by 19.9% to N218.7 billion compared to the prior year. This significant growth in revenue despite the challenging macro-economic environment was driven by pricing initiatives across the portfolio, the successful launch of its “No DNA Needed, Originally Black” campaign and the introduction of its well-received premium brand, Flying Fish; all of which sustained consumer demand across product list. Carlos Coutino, Managing Director, International Breweries Plc said: “Our momentum can be attributed to our consistent execution of our commercial strategy, revenue management initiatives and the implementation of a deliberate route-to-market strategy alongside a technology-enhanced trade ecosystem, allowing us to serve our distributors and retailers better.” Coutino concluded by reiterating the Company’s commitment to investing in its people and fostering a culture of long-term growth and value creation throughout the organisation with continued enhancements to its operating model. While 2022 was characterised by higher energy prices, FX illiquidity, material cost headwinds and supply chain disruptions, revenue increased by 8.0% in Q4 2022 vis-à-vis the previous year and EBITDA growth was at the upper end of the company’s medium-term growth ambition and outlook. The Company also achieved a 12.3% reduction in administrative expenses driven by a reclassification of depreciation from administrative expenses to cost of sales. In his remarks, Finance Director, David Tomlinson stated that “Despite the ever-changing business environment, we remain steadfast in executing our strategy, which has propelled our business forward.”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Tomlinson said that: “Our focus on revenue management, organisational structure and commercial investment continues to position us for annual growth.
