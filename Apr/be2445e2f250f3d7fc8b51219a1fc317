The Nigeria Police Force has arrested a 23-year-old, Kelvin Enofe, for mpersonating Nollywood actor and producer, Ikechukwu Mitchel Ogbonna, professionally known as IK Ogbonna. The impersonator allegedly defrauded a United States woman of $70,000. Reacting to the incident, IK Ogbonna, in a post on his Instagram page warned fraudsters to desist from using him to scam people. IK wrote, “This is to inform the public to be wary of all those who are using my name and picture to defraud unsuspecting innocent women in love relationship scams on social media. One of such is the recent case of a 23 years old boy, Kelvin Enofe, who duped an American lady of over 70 thousand US dollars, but as God would have it, some private investigators came to the lady’s rescue by revealing the true identity of the scammer. “Upon the said investigation, Nigerian police went for Kelvin’s arrest, investigated the matter, and he is now standing trial at the Lagos Nigeria Magistrate Court in Igbosere. I do this again today to let the general public know that there are a lot more of other persons claiming to be IK Ogbonna on the Internet. ”Great job from Spaurell Private Investigators Ltd and the Nig police.”
