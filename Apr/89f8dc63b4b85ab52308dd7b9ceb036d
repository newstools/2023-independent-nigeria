ABUJA – Eighth National Assem­bly Senator from Kadu­na Central, Shehu Sani, has called on the All Progressives Congress (APC) to give the office of the Senate President (SP) to the South East region. He said that this will ensure equity, justice and unity for Ni­geria. He also asked the governing party to single out the former Abia State governor, Orji Uzor Kalu, among persons jostling for the coveted seat, and make him the new Senate President. According to Senator Sani, the APC should consider this above any primordial senti­ments, and in the interest of the nation. The Kaduna lawmaker who said this when he was answer­ing questions from journalists in Abuja on Thursday, believes that the region has Senators competent enough to be the SP if the rules like ‘ranking’ were to be considered. He explained, “The Senate Presidency should go to the South East for equity and jus­tice. “There is no better person to stabilise the National Assembly and maintain balance like Orji Uzor Kalu, particularly that he has demonstrated his flair as Chief Whip of the Senate.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “I’m not of the APC but I think he remains the best op­tion out of those who offered themselves and Kalu has the experience and the pedigree as well.” POLL Though he is not a member of APC, the Human Rights ac­tivist noted that at the level of governance, every citizen is a stakeholder to doing normal things for the nation to move forward. He further argued that the incumbent structure of the APC has naturally positioned the South East to produce the 10th Senate President. Some Senators have indicat­ed interest to head the Upper Chamber. Among them is Sen­ator Sani Musa, Dave Umahi, Orji Uzor Kalu, among others.
