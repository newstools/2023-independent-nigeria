Amid campaign to remove her from the movie, Amber Heard has made a fleeting appearance in the new trailer for ‘Aquaman 2’. During the CinemaCon 2023 event in Las Vegas, Warner Bros. debuted the preview for ‘Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom’, which will see Jason Momoa and Heard reprise their roles as aquatically gifted heroes and love interests Arthur and Mera. Though the trailer hasn’t been released to the public yet, the studio confirmed Wednesday to the Los Angeles Times that Heard is in it. According to reports, Heard’s Mera shows up briefly during a battle scene in the preview. Reports of Heard’s cameo in the trailer surfaced years after Johnny Depp supporters launched an online campaign to remove her from the sequel. The virtual petition has received more than 4.6 million signatures. The petition, which labels Heard a “domestic abuser”, got a major boost last spring when Heard and her ex-husband, Depp, traded allegations of domestic violence and abuse at their high-profile defamation trial in Virginia. The jury ended up awarding Depp more than $10 million, while Heard received $2 million. “I’m heartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power, influence, and sway of my ex-husband,” Heard said in a statement after losing the case. “It sets back the clock to a time when a woman who spoke up and spoke out could be publicly shamed and humiliated. It sets back the idea that violence against women is to be taken seriously.” During the trial, Heard testified that she nearly lost her role in “Aquaman” due to the media firestorm surrounding her legal battles with Depp. However, the then-president of Warner Bros. Pictures claimed in a video deposition that Heard was almost recast because of a lack of onscreen “chemistry” between her and Momoa — not because of the Depp controversy. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Directed by James Wan, “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” is scheduled to open in theaters in December 20.
