Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, who was part of the presidential entourage, stated that the Presidential aircraft landed at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport at 5:08 pm, Wednesday, after nearly seven hours for a four to five-hour Jeddah-Abuja flight due to the ongoing situation in Sudan that warrants the avoidance of the country’s entire airspace by air traffic. The rerouted aircraft flew from Jeddah, in Saudi Arabia through Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, DRC, Central African Republic, Cameroon and eventually Nigeria.
