Russian businessman Viktor Bout has sent a wire to former US President Donald Trump, inviting him to Russia, local media reported on Friday. “Today, I sent a telegram to former US President Donald Trump. First of all, I believe that his life is in danger. The trial that has begun in New York will not end with Donald Trump just getting convicted and losing his chance at the presidency,” Bout said after sending the wire, according to the state-run TASS news agency. The Russian businessman invited Trump to Moscow and offered him protection and political asylum so that he can lead “a rebellion against the globalists and save the American people.” Bout, an arms smuggler, was released as part of a prisoner swap between Russia and the US last December. He was arrested in Bangkok in 2008 on a warrant issued by a local court at the US’ request. In April 2012, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison and fined $15 million. (SOURCE: Anadolu Agency)
