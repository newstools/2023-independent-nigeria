IBADAN  – The Landlords and Landladies Association of Ebedi Commu­nity Phase 11, in Iseyin Local Government Area of Oyo State, on Sunday, commended Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, for approving the construction of the 2.65 kilometer road in the community. The road network was spon­sored by Iseyin Local Govern­ment Area after the governor ordered its construction because of the effects of flooding and erosion on the residents and it spanned along Asado road, Bayo Raji road, Iseyin Local Govern­ment’s Quater’s road, among others. The association commend­ed the Iseyin local government Chairman, Mufutau Abilawon, for making necessary support available for the project comple­tion to be achieved. They also showed their grati­tude to the contractor of the proj­ect while speaking with journal­ists after an emergency meeting, which they held at Odo-Oro area of the community, where execu­tive members of the association met with a special road construc­tion monitoring committee, set up to ensure due process during the project execution. The Chairman, Landlords and Landladies Association of Ebedi Community Phase 11, Mustapha Ibrahim, said the construction of the community road has eased the burden of motorists and motorcycle riders and opened the area to further development. Ibrahim disclosed that the area, where the largest assem­blage of Garri processing facto­ries were located, would benefit more as trucks offloading cassa­va and those loading bags of Gar­ri to Lagos and other commercial cities will have easy access to the area. He added that the construc­tion of the road and culverts has saved residents from hazards of gully erosion and flooding that have claimed lives of some peo­ple in the past.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “We appreciate our dear governor for doing this for us, it will be in the record that this road was constructed during his time to alleviate the suffering of residents, it used to be a terrible network of roads within this community, today, we can see the criss-cross of tarred roads that has contributed to the develop­ment of our area.
