The Kebbi state chairman of the Labour Party, Alhaji Muhammad Nasit Dan Hajia has rejected calls by loyalists of the presidential candidate of LP, Mr Peter Obi to leave Nigeria amid growing tension. According to him, Obi should stay in the country to see to the peaceful and constitutional restoration of the mandate even as he decried the extremism deployed in the mandate restoration struggle which he said is dimming the popularity of the party. The state chairman lamented the systematic division of LP in Kebbi, adding that a huge number of resident Igbos turned up during the presidential polls but failed to do so during the governorship elections making it look like an Igbo party which, according to him, is not true. “Labour party as a National party must, therefore, desist from giving ethnic colouration”; he posited. He explained that such an attitude was responsible for the poor outing of the party at the guber polls even as the guber candidate is from Zuru Emirate in the person of Gambo Paul. Nasir described preposterous allegations of treason against Mister Obi and the calls for his arrest as laughable even as he urged Obi’s teeming supporters in Kebbi to remain peaceful and law-abiding to await a court decision on the mandate.
