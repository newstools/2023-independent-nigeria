JOS  – The All Progressives Con­gress (APC) leaders, un­der the aegis of the North Central APC Forum, have organised prayer sessions for the success of the forth­coming inauguration of the president-elect, Bola Tinubu, on May 29. Speaking on behalf of the forum in Jos, the Plateau State capital, after their post Easter and Sallah meeting as well as their strategic action plan towards the inaugura­tion ceremony, chairman of the forum, Alhaji Saleh Mandung Zazzaga, said the prayer sessions had become necessary following prob­able unforeseen threats against the success of the ceremony. He said the forum’s Mus­lim members, including him­self, who went for pilgrimage to the holy land of Saudi Ara­bia and just returned a day or two ago, had already com­menced a preliminary prayer sessions for the country gen­erally for smooth transition process, while their Christian members back at home were equally observing their own prayers. However, he said the offi­cial commencement of the prayer sessions among their members and accompanying supporters would be on Sat­urday, April 29 which would be exactly one month to the inauguration. “Prayers for a hitch-free transition process and the eventual inauguration of the President-elect, Bola Tinubu, come May 29 has become im­perative following forces and other perceived threat work­ing against it. For instance, there are several suits against Tinubu which mischief mak­ers are trying to use that to ob­struct the occasion. “Again, there is the threat from several quarters calling for an interim government, and the security agencies themselves have acknowl­edged such threats. “With all these threats and unforeseen others, we have decided to commence this prayer sessions among the ad­herents of the different faiths so that the inauguration will come and go successfully and the new government can take off on a sound footing,” he said.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Zazzaga pointed out that with prayers Tinubu will also have divine direction in his administration, particularly in the area of selecting the lieutenants he will be work­ing with, as making wrong appointments is the fastest thing that could mare his ad­ministration. POLL In view of this, he stressed that the forum is again call­ing the president-elect to pick the director general of his presidential campaign, Governor Simon Lalong as the Secretary to the Gov­ernment of the Federation (SGF).
