West Ham are battling Arsenal and Everton for “outstanding” Villarreal winger Samuel Chukwueze, according to Spanish newspaper, Mundo Deportivo. The Nigerian has been in excellent form of late and “dazzled” in the Yellow Submarine’s 3-2 win over Real Madrid on 8 April (Mundo Deportvio, pg 18, 21 April). Chukwueze, 23, has yet to sign a new deal with the Spanish club and could well look to move in the summer with his current deal expiring in 2024. It’s understood there is Premier League interest in the wide man, who has 24 goals and assists in all competitions during the 2022/23 season. Promising Everton were on the coattails of Chukwueze during the summer of 2022 and only just missed out towards the end of the window. However, considering the Toffees’ current league position, there’s probably more chance of the winger making the move to the London Stadium. There’s certainly a better feeling around the club after the draw against Arsenal and the win over Gent on Thursday evening. Another victory against Bournemouth on Sunday will put the Hammers on the brink of survival. A piece of silverware and avoiding relegation would constitute a good season’s work, considering how bad it has been at some points.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ If West Ham are a Premier League club come the end of the season, they probably stand a decent chance of landing a player of Chukwueze’s quality. Said Benrahma and Jarrod Bowen have been Moyes’ go-to wingers, with the latter in scintillating form at present. POLL Nonetheless, another quality addition would be welcomed. If West Ham want to avoid a repeat of the 2022/23 league campaign, there has to be some sort of activity during the off-season. (SOURCE: West Ham Zone)
