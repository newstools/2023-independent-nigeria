N’Golo Kante and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang are summer targets for Barcelona. While Chelsea team-mate Hakim Ziyech is wanted by Napoli and could be used as bait in any potential move to take Victor Osimhen or Khvica Kvaratskhelia to Stamford Bridge. A huge summer clearout is on the cards in south-west London after Todd Boehly and fellow co-owners splashed £600million on new signings over the past 12 months. And while the departures of Aubameyang and Ziyech will come as little surprise, the fact Barca believe Kante might be available will likely divide opinion amongst Chelsea supporters. The World Cup-winning midfielder’s contract expires in the summer, although the Blues have an option to extend his stay. That option runs out in May, though, and if Boehly and Co haven’t triggered it by then it will open the door to suitors. Barcelona want to offer Kante a two-year deal, although given the Spaniards’ financial situation, his wages will not match those he collects at Chelsea. Barca hope to raise around £180million in sales this summer that they can reinvest in at least three top-quality players.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Boss Xavi has handed a list of proposed targets to the Catalan club’s hierarchy and, like Kante, Aubameyang appears on it. POLL The former Arsenal captain joined Chelsea from Barcelona in September but has had a miserable time back in London. And Barca, for whom he scored 13 goals in 24 games, will offer him an exit route, albeit on vastly reduced wages and only if they can get him for next to nothing having sold him for around £10m. Xavi and Co want an answer from Aubameyang by the first week in June. (SOURCE: Mirror UK)
