NNEWI  – The sanitation cleanup exercise that took place in Anambra State on International Fools Day, April 1, 2023 has been described as an imposition against the rights of the citizens of the state and other Nigerians in general. A community leader, IIman­na Ekaha, said the exercise curtailed the rights of citizens travelling to Anambra and oth­er places who unexpectedly met the resistance of thugs at Nnobi Junction in Idemili South Local Government Area of the state, who stopped them from travel­ling to their destinations between the hours of 8 and 10 am on Sat­urday, April 1, 2023. Ekaha who stated this on Sun­day in an interview said he was travelling from Akwa Ibom State to Awka for a burial ceremony in the state, urging Governor Chukwuma Soludo to do away with bad advisers, noting that Sanitation and cleanup exercis­es were held last Saturday of the month. “Everybody knows that sani­tation and cleanup exercises are held last Saturday of the month. It is the work of bad advisers. Governor Soludo should do away with them,” the community lead­er said. This is even as traders in the state allegedly blamed the Anam­bra State Government, saying the state government allegedly deviated from the norm and im­posed the clean up exercise on the citizenry on Fools’ Day for inex­plicable reasons while they also chided the transition committee chair for Idemili South, Amaka Obi, and president general of Nnobi, Barrister Dominic Ok­pala, for being complacent and inconsiderate. During the exercise, commut­er buses, motorcycles among oth­er vehicles were turned back at Nnobi Junction where officials on ‘Solution is Here’ attire barri­caded the road to the dismay of okada operators, drivers and pas­sengers while youths said to be APGA thugs took over the Nno­bi Junction where all in an effort to enforce the cleanup exercise, fought with motor park touts who dared to query them on why the exercise was not done last Sat­urday of the month of March. Sources told Daily Indepen­dent that the road was also bar­ricaded at the Agulu Road axis bypass of the junction where some thugs extorted N200 each from every passenger, com­muter buses and other vehicles before they were allowed to ply the road.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Trouble was said to have start­ed, leading to exchange of blows, when some motorcycle operators and motor park touts resisted the alleged APGA thugs from stop­ping them from going about their business.
