LAGOS – Kunle Adegoke, Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) has given reason the court is going to hear the application by Aisha Dahiru Ahmed popularly called Binani, the Adamawa State All Progressives Congress (APC) gubernatorial candidate, stressing that the court should hear the case to give room to fair hearing. Adegoke on Arise TV on Wednesday said, “Developments in Adamawa State in the past few weeks call for concern and interestingly we are happy the parties are not taking laws into their hands but rather approached the court of law whether rightly or otherwise. “The ex parte application before the court is one that everybody should be courteously about. They have a right to fair hearing. While the thing that has been done might be in violation of the right of fair hearing of a particular party or citizen, it is a nullity in the eyes of the law, and that must have informed his lordship to direct counsel through the applicant to rather put the other party on notice so that the application can be argued and robust reasons can be preferred by either side, why the court should hear the application in the first place because anything done by the court without jurisdiction is a nullity and a waste of time and taxpayers money. “I do not think that there is anything to worry about in as far as the court is already entertaining the application. The court is ready to entertain the application and fix a date, and if the court finds out that the decision of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to go ahead and take further steps is wrong in law, then the court may be able to grant a decision that may nullify such steps taken by INEC, and whether the court has such powers or otherwise is a different issue. He added, “Where the court judges that the commission has the power to do what it has done, definitely it will refuse the application that the party has brought in this regard. The implication is that the ex parte application has been converted to one on notice, it is no longer an ex parte application because the other party will be available to equally say why the application should not be granted.” On whether Binani is culpable in the action of the REC, he said, “However, Senator Binani if I were in her shoes, I wouldn’t be unconstitutional and illegal and for her to have taken this step that she has been declared winner in this particular election and on that basis accepted it, she has thrown up a lot of legal questions, issues bothering on the constitutionality, the legality or otherwise of the declaration made by the REC, and having accepted the declaration as the winner of that election, can INEC still go further to take any step to say further collation or a contrary declaration in this instance, well to the delight of lawyers, that is something that has brought bread and butter on some tables. “I believe that the development may not necessarily suggest the kind of connivance between Senator Binani and the REC, although there may be suspicions of such a thing, but ordinary suspicion will not be enough to establish culpability in law,” he said.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
