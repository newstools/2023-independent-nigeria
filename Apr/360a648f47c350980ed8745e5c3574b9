The Magistrates court sitting in Ogba, Ikeja, Lagos State, has sentenced a teenager, Solomon Uzuokwu, to one-month imprisonment for making prank calls to emergency responders. He was convicted by Magistrate Bambo Odueke of the two counts charge of bridging the public peace and making a hoax fire emergency call. Magistrate Odueke gave the ruling with an option of a fine and a month of community service campaign against false calls within the jurisdiction of the State. But, the defendant, however, opted for the fine after he pleaded guilty to the charge. The Director, of Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service, Mrs Margaret Adeseye, in a statement signed by the Deputy Director, of Public Affairs, Agboola Ololade, on Friday said the ruling followed the court’s acknowledgement of the noble firefighting profession and the effective service delivery of the agency that required the encouragement of all and sundry.
