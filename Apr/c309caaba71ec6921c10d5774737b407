All train traffic in eastern Austria was temporarily suspended on Thursday morning due to a technical problem, a spokeswoman told dpa. The areas of Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland were affected, the spokeswoman for operator Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) said. The massive outage began at around 8.15 am (0615 GMT), triggered by a malfunction in a signal box in Vienna. It also interrupted long-distance connections. Technicians repaired the fault and trains began running again around an hour later, according to the spokeswoman. However, anyone planning to travel by train should allow for an additional half hour of travel time until traffic is restored to normal, according to the operator ÖBB’s website.(dpa/NAN)
