LAGOS  – Super Falcons coach Randy Waldrum has admitted that the team still has to improve despite their 3-0 defeat of New Zealand on Tuesday. Coach Waldrum was happy with the result, but the American believes there were still some areas that need improvement. “I would give the team a B, we got the three goals, we got the clean sheet so I guess maybe I’m a little harsh with that grade,” Waldrum told NFF TV. “But there are still many things that we can work and improve on, but I think we’ll get there. “I think these last two camps we’ve been good. We’ve gotten better and better. This is what we needed going into the World Cup,” said Waldrum. Recall that the Super Falcons defeated Haiti 2-1 in their first friendly game last Friday. Then they followed up with a 3-0 victory over New Zealand on Tuesday. Goals from Onome Ebi, Jennifer Echegini, and Desire Oparanozie sealed the 3-0 victory for the nine-time African cham­pions.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ However, the Super Falcons still looked shaky in some areas. Captain Onome Ebi made a few mistakes that could have cost the team, but goalkeeper Nnadoz­ie was always there to save her blushes. POLL Also, the attackers lacked the cutting edge on different occasions that they could have scored. Waldrum has until July to per­fect his plans if he wants the Super Falcons to go far at the FIFA Wom­en’s World Cup. He would hope that their winning run continues and that they take that form to the World Cup. Nigeria, Morocco, South Africa and Zambia would be representing Africa at the World Cup and the nine –time Africa champions are in Group B alongside Australia, Republic of Ireland and Canada. The FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023 takes place in Australia and New Zealand from July 20 to Au­gust 20 and it is the first Women’s World Cup to feature 32 teams com­peting in eight groups.
