Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has insisted that it is too early to declare that his team are “out of the woods” in terms of eradicating the inconsistencies which have blighted their season. The midweek victory over West Ham made it three wins in succession, extended their unbeaten run to five matches, and maintained their outside chance of sneaking into the top four. On Sunday at home to Tottenham, Liverpool have a chance to win a fourth league game in a row for only the second time this season – that came in November and December and was separated by the World Cup – but Klopp said it would be wrong to assume everything had now clicked back into place. “It is, for me too early to speak about consistency,” he said. “Winning three games is not for me consistent, it is good but can only be the start of something. “It is about consistency you show in performances even more than results. For the outside world it is the result but for us it must be performances because that is what we work with. “I am happy with that in the moment because in all the games, as different as they were, I saw a lot of things we want to see in the games and that is then really good.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “There is always something to improve and that’s fine that’s what we try to do as well. POLL “I am absolutely OK with the moment but it is not that I already trust ourselves that much to say ‘That’s it now, we are out of the woods’ because this season gave us a few lessons I didn’t want to learn, but learned.
