A former Senate Leader and legal luminary, Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba (SAN) has assured that the incoming administra­tion of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu that will be inaugurat­ed on May 29, 2023, will meet the expectations of Nigerians. Ndoma-Egba, an erstwhile Chairman of Niger Delta De­velopment Commission (NDDC) and chieftain of All Progres­sives Congress (APC) gave the assurance when a group, Pro­gressives Advisory Forum For Good Governance (PAFOGG), paid him a visit in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, according to a Radio Nigeria report. The APC stalwart main­tained that Tinubu has what it takes to offer good governance and make the country a better place for Nigerians, while call­ing on all and sundry to give him the support he needed to excel in office as Nigeria’s President from May 29. “He (Tinubu) has the an­tecedent. He has the back­ground. I have no doubt. But, he has to be encouraged. He has to be helped by all of us who sup­ported his emergence and even those who do not support it. “He has to be helped in every way possible to meet the very tall expectations of Nigerians. Part of meeting the expectations is being fair and just to every sec­tion of the country.” He stressed the need for the incoming administration to use national integration as a tool for Nigeria’s development and give all geo-political zones a sense of belonging. On the leadership of the 10th National Assembly, the ex-par­liamentarian suggested that the office of the Senate President should be zoned to the Southeast.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “Where we are now is the point of national integration and my own position has been for the leadership of the Nation­al Assembly, let us look at the part of the country (Southeast) that has consistently cried over marginalization,” he advocated. POLL Speaking earlier, the leader of the group, Mr. Nwosu Em­manuel, implored the incom­ing administration to consider loyalty, commitment and com­petence in selecting cabinet members.
