Thomas Muller could make Champions League history if his Bayern Munich side beat Manchester City on Tuesday. Muller has won 99 games in the Champions League across his career, and another victory this week will see him join Cristiano Ronaldo and Iker Casillas as the only players to reach a century of wins in the competition. The German attacker’s record will be unique though as he would become the first player to reach 100 wins with a single club. Ronaldo’s wins came during spells with Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus, while Casillas ended his career with Porto – with neither player getting 100 wins during their lengthy spells in Madrid. Bayern will have their work cut out in going for victory at the Etihad though, as Man City have won their last eight matches in all competitions. The German champions have also only ever won once away to City in the competition, and that came in 2013 when the manager they are about to face, Pep Guardiola, was in charge of them. However, the recent arrival of Thomas Tuchel as manager may help, as he has got a very good record against Guardiola in big games, having beaten City with Chelsea in both the 2021 FA Cup semi-finals and Champions League final.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ (SOURCE: Sports Mole)
