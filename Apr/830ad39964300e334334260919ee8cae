Following the reported cases of secret cult-induced attacks and acts of murder in some parts of Enugu State, the Commissioner of Police, CP Ahmed Ammani, has ordered Area Commanders, Divisional Police Officers and heads of Tactical Teams of the state Command, to use all the operational and intelligence resources at their disposal to further clampdown on the crim­inal elements and bring them to justice. This CP gave the order in view of the arrest of 26 male suspects between the ages of 18 and 40 years, at different locations in the state, by Police operatives of the Command’s Anti-cultism Squad. He said the suspects, all linked to the crime, confessed to being members of Supreme Vikings and Black Axe Confra­ternities that are respectively involved in the cult war. “Preliminary investigations revealed that some members of Black Axe confraternity, on 29/03/2023 at about 2230hrs, conspired, shot and injured a member of Supreme Vikings confraternity in the arm, at Emene, Enugu. On receipt of the information, members of Supreme Vikings confraterni­ty, in solidarity with their mur­dered member, conspired and declared war against members of Black Axe confraternity, which has led to counter and counter murderous armed at­tacks between the secret cult groups in different parts of Enugu metropolis, Agbani and Nsukka areas of the state. The investigations further revealed that the attacks have led to the murder of a yet-to-be ascer­tained number of individuals on different dates and times in the mentioned locations. “The suspects were today, 20/04/2023, arraigned in court and remanded in the Nigerian Correctional Custodial Cen­tre; while frantic operational and investigative efforts are on course to apprehend and bring other perpetrators of the act to book,“ he stated. Meanwhile, the commis­sioner has urged parents, guardians, community and religious leaders in the state to caution and dissuade their children, wards, or subjects from partaking in secret cult­ism and its related criminal ac­tivities, as the Police would not relent, in line with extant laws, to deal decisively with anyone apprehended. He further enjoined the citizenry to continue to sup­port the Police, by promptly reporting criminal suspects and their activities, including those of secret-cult groups, to the nearest Police Station or by calling the Command’s Emer­gency Hotlines on 08032003702, 08075380883, 08086671202 or 08098880172.
