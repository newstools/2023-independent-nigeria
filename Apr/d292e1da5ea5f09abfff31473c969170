Qatar’s Sheikh Jassim has now made a world-record bid to buy Manchester United from the Glazer family. Interested parties had until Friday (April 28) to submit their final bids for the club and, according to reports, Sheikh Jassim, the chairman of Qatar Islamic Bank, has offered a figure in excess of £5bn. That would represent the biggest ever price for a sporting club or franchise if accepted, double the £2.5bn a US-led consortium paid to take control of Chelsea last year. Despite that, it still falls below the £6bn the Glazers ideally want to relinquish full control at Old Trafford. However, it is also reported to be a ‘take it or leave it’ offer from the Qataris, who are determined not to pay over the odds. Sheikh Jassim, the son of a former Qatari prime minister, was the first prospective owner to publicly confirm a bid. INEOS owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe quickly followed on Friday night lodging a final bid of his own, with both parties having made trips to Manchester last month to visit the club and speak to the senior hierarchy. n addition to Sheikh Jassim and Ratcliffe, the likes of Carlyle, Elliott Management, Ares Management and Sixth Street reportedly made minority investment proposals. It has also been reported this week that one option on the table could see Ratcliffe take a controlling stake of more than 50 per cent, with Avram and Joel Glazer retaining a combined 20 per cent. Ratcliffe’s representatives did not comment on the matter when contacted by the PA news agency.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ In the wake of that story, the 1958 – a United supporters group that came to prominence last year – posted on Twitter: “If you get in bed with Glazer. You are a Glazer. The fans will have their say this Sunday. FULL SALE ONLY.” POLL United fans have let their fury known at the Glazers ever since their leveraged takeover in 2005 and the 1958 have led renewed protests against them for the past year.
