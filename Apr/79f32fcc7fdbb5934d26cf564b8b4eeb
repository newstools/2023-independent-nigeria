Multiple cases of Covid-19 have resurfaced in Jaffna, causing one death while five others have been quarantined. A 71-year-old from Puttur Jaffna passed away whilst receiving treatment for the virus on Thursday. Earlier this week, five people were sent to a quarantine centre in Jaffna after an individual received treatment for an unrelated ailment, was found to be exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19. Following this incident, patients admitted to the general ward for treatment at the teaching hospital in Jaffna were administered Covid-19 tests, as many were displaying unabated fever symptoms. Of the patients tested, three were found to be positive for Covid-19 and were immediately transferred to the government quarantine centre. In their latest epidemiological update on Covid-19, the World Health Organisation (WHO) stated that there have been over 2.8 million new cases and approximately 18,000 deaths were reported between 20 March to 16 April 2023.
