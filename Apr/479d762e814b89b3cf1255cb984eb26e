The Bank of Industry Group has announced that it delivered an outstanding financial and developmental performance result in the year ended 31st December 2022, despite the headwinds that followed the COVID-19-induced recession in 2020. The bank continued its growth in major financial indices on a year-on-year basis, thus consolidating its position as Nigeria’s largest and most impactful Development Finance Institution. The group’s total assets crossed the N2 trillion mark in 2022 to N2.38 trillion, indicating a 39.2 per cent growth when compared with the preceding year. “This significant leap was achieved following the successful conclusion of three landmark capital raising transactions in the year, worth N1.85 billion (about $2 billion) from the international financial markets. Gross earnings grew by 15.4 percent to N212.96 billion in 2022 from N184.55 billion in 2021. In the same vein, interest income from both customer loans and investments improved by 21.1 per cent in 2022 to N212.96 billion from N175.83 billion in the previous year. “Also, profit before tax rose by 15.6 percent to N71.99 billion in the year, from N62.28 billion in 2021 due to remarkable growth in interest income and other income lines; alongside the reduction in impairment charges. Total equity grew by 11.7 per cent to N429.83 billion from N384.85 billion in 2021, while loans and advances improved by 3.2 per cent to N805.46 billion from N780.48 billion in 2021, “BOI said. In its developmental impact, the bank said it disbursed the sum of N210.7 billion to 418,436 beneficiaries in the year, through both direct and indirect lending platforms, as well as through funds it manages on behalf of its strategic partners. “The three key capital raising transactions in the year from the international financial market included the bank’s maiden Eurobond of N750 million, which was concluded in February 2022. It was the first of its kind in several ways to the bank, the country and Africa. This deal was the bank’s first Eurobond transaction, as well as the first Euro-denominated Eurobond transaction in Nigeria. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The transaction was also the first Eurobond transaction that was covered by Nigeria’s sovereign guarantee and also represents the first of its kind by a national Development Finance Institution in Africa. POLL “This transaction earned the bank, the Agency Bond Deal of the Year award at the 2023 Awards event of the Bonds, Loans and ESG Capital Markets in Capetown, South Africa. The second was the N1 billion guaranteed senior loan facility, which was concluded in August of 2022. “This deal also represents the first of its kind, by any Nigerian financial institution, both in terms of its size and structure. Through this transaction, the bank was not only able to raise liquidity, but was also able to diversify its funding sources by attracting new lenders, despite the fact that the international capital markets were prohibitively expensive and shut to many borrowers at the time, it said.
