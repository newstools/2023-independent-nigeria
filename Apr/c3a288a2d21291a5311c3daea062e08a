Most, if not all, Liverpool fans wanted the club to sign Jude Bellingham this summer. Yet as we all know by now, that’s not going to happen, given the current cost of bringing the teenager to Liverpool and with Jürgen Klopp needing to revamp other sections of the squad. So, efforts have begun to identify other potential midfielders not named Bellingham. One of those is USMNT star Yunus Musah, who has been linked with the club for a while at this stage (via 90Min). Musah was once in Arsenal’s youth academy but left for Valencia in the summer of 2019, although it now seems that there might be a queue of clubs ready to bring him back to England, including Liverpool. According to 90min, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal are in talks with Musah’s representatives ahead of a potential move to the Premier League, with Newcastle United and Brighton & Hove Albion also keen on the player. Musah was one of the USMNT’s best players at the 2022 World Cup, and despite having a $110m (£89m/€100m) release clause in his contract, Valencia’s financial means aren’t in a position to refuse each and every offer. Musah has made 29 appearances for the Spanish side this season and has provided two assists. Valencia is struggling near the bottom of La Liga, sitting in 19th place.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Liverpool.com says: Musah impressed during the World Cup for the USMNT and given Valencia’s dire situation at the bottom of the table, and should they get relegated, Liverpool could bring him back to England for relatively little. At just 20, he could be part of the Liverpool midfield for the next decade.
