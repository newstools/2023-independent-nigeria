He said, “We were four inside the car travelling from Lagos when we heard a gunshot at our front. In the process of trying to run away we landed in their hands but two of us ran inside the bush and escaped while two of us were in their hands. ” When they caught us around 12: p.m . of that fateful day, they asked us to follow them to their den. On our way to their den we walked from 12 p.m. till 8 a.m.of the next day before we finally reached where they would hide us. He narrated that we really saw hell in the hands of a kidnapper. My second person was matcheted on one of his legs; they asked me to carry him on my back to a place where they would hide us. “They beat us everyday, they tied my hands at the back and beat me everyday. As you can see, I was injured in the face. The abductors hit my face with a gun butt. As you can see my body, this is the sign of treatment I was re­ceiving everyday while in the kidnappers’ den,” he said.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ When asked whether there was food for them, he said,” “They left us without food for five days. It was half cup of water only ev­eryday they were giving us since the day they took us to their den. If they were eating food they would ask us to turn our face to­wards them. POLL “We paid a ransom of 600,000 before we were free to reunite with our families; that is each of us paid three hundred thousand as a ransom 300,000.”
