Governor Babagana Uma­ra Zulum has felicitated with Christians in Bor­no State and the rest of Nigeria on the ongoing Easter festival. Zulum, in a message released by his spokesman, Malam Isa Gusau, urged residents of Bor­no State to pray for the full resto­ration of peace in the state and to also pray that the second term of his administration will be guid­ed by God to deliver on hundreds of infrastructural projects, pro­grammes and policies that will improve living standards in ways that will far surpass what was achieved during the governor’s first term that will soon end on May 29, 2023. According to Zulum’s state­ment: “On behalf of the Borno State government, I heartily felic­itate with our Christian brothers and sisters in Borno and across Nigeria at this Easter season. “I urge security agencies to sustain their good efforts in preserving security during the festivities and far beyond. “I call on all celebrants to make sacrifices in reaching out to family members, friends, neighbours and other commu­nity members who might be in need of help. “As we round up our first term, I want to specially request that all the good people of Borno State commit our second term to prayers by devoutly asking God to guide us towards the full resto­ration of peace, towards the safe resettlement of residents still displaced, towards the reviving of means of livelihoods across all communities previously affected by insurgents’ destructions and the strengthening of economies in areas less affected by attacks in all senatorial zones. “I also seek prayers that God guides us to undertake hundreds of meaningful infrastructural projects, programmes and poli­cies that will fairly impact on all our 27 local government areas.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “Above all, I seek prayers that God sustains our human efforts to be good leaders whose hearts and minds will remain over­whelmed by the sincerest desire to serve the good people of Borno State.”
