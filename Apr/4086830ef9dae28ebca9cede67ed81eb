The Plateau State government alongside 12 members of the state House of Assembly have appealed the Judgement of Justice Nafisat Musa who reinstated Abok Nuhu Ayuba as the Speaker of the Plateau state house of Assembly, 18 Months after he was impeached. The appellants have approached the Court of Appeal on three grounds that the claimants lack the locus standi to challenge the removal of the Abok Ayuba from office as Speaker of the Plateau State House of Assembly when he himself has not done so. The appellants also claim that the judge erred in law when she refused to entertain the notice of Preliminary objection filed by the Defendants challenging the jurisdiction of the trial court to entertain the Claimantsâ€™ suit but rather dismissed the hearing of it. In a suit with case number SUIT NO: PLD/J585/21, the appellants are also claiming that the judge erred in law when he refused to entertain the Motion on Notice of the Defendants filed on 12/12/2022, but struck out same without hearing the Defendants on it. The appellant are also seeking for an order setting aside the judgment of the lower court and sending the case back to the High Court of Justice of Plateau State for retrial by another Judge Justice Musa had in her judgement on Monday granted the prayers of the claimantshaving considered all prayers of claimants and the facts that the defendants did not defend any of reliefs sought or file anything to show that they intend to defend the suit granted all the 10 reliefs sought by the claimants.
