BENIN – An Edo state Labour Party stalwart, Pastor Dr. Oghogho Okundaye has enjoined Muslims to use this period to pray for the peaceful coexistence of the country especially now that the country is going through economic challenges. The admonition was contained in a goodwill message by the Labour Party Chieftain while felicitating with Muslim on the celebration of Eid-el-Fitri after the successful  completion of the Ramadan  fast. Okundaye in the message said no matter the difficulty the country might be going through for now, the people should not loose hope as the nation would some day overcome the issues and enjoined them to continuously pray for the country. Okundaye urged them to sustain  the lesson of sacrifice, selflessness, tolerance, loving one another and above all imbibe the spirit of discipline. The virtues, according to him, are necessary not only for achieving peace and unity but sustaining social economic growth of both Edo state and the country at large. Okundaye who participated in the agitation for the creation of Edo state also encouraged the Muslim faithful to always show tender love and care to one another and to other religious as that was one of the greatest teachings of Prophet Mohammed especially at this time when many are experiencing hardship. The Labour Party Chieftain however used the opportunity to reassure Edo people that sooner or later their worries would be over when the progressives are in authority, just as he enjoin them to continue to be law abiding and peaceful despite any form of provocation occasioned by bad policies of government.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
