Abba Kabir Yusuf, the Kano State Governor-elect, on Wednesday, described the death of an Elder statesman, Alhaji Musa , as a painful loss to the State at a time the leadership needed invaluable counsel from maverick politicians of his status. Abba Kabir Yusuf noted that posterity will be kind to the late Alhaji Gwadabe for his various contributions to democratic entrenchment and political decency he stood for while serving as Nigeria’s Minister of Labour and Productivity and Secretary to the Government of Kano State. He said Alhaji Gwadabe’s virtues challenged all the politicians and individuals in positions of influence to strive hard towards leaving life better than they met it. A statement signed on Wednesday by his Chief Press Secretary, Sunusi Bature Dawakin Tofa, said the Governor-elect, prayed unto Allah to forgive Alhaji Gwadabe’s shortcomings and grant him Janatul Furdausi. Engr. Abba further expressed his deepest condolences to the family of the late illustrious statesman and the people of Kano.
