United Baptist Mission of Nige­ria, Benin, yesterday, ordained Robert Osama Usuanlele as the first Archbishop of the church. The ordination minister, Archbishop John Osa Oni while administering the consecration oath, said Archbishop Usuanlele has been found worthy spiritually and in character and the knowl­edge of the Holy word of God. “I now declare that you are now His Eminence, the Most Rev. Dr. Osama Usuanlele, the Archbishop of the United Baptist Mission of Nigeria in the name of the Father, the son and of the Holy Spirit” Speaking on the topic: “Stew­ardship”, taken from 1Conrithian 4:1-2, the immediate past Presi­dent of the Pentecostal Fellow­ship of Nigeria (PFN), Rev. Felix Omobude, said that he (Usuan­lele) has been called to serve the flock of Christ. He said stewardship demands accountability as God rewards faithfulness and not the office. The former PFN president, therefore, urged the congregants to be faithful in whatever duty that has been assigned to them by God. On the part of the newly or­dained Archbishop, Usuanlele, he said his ordination is a call to serve the body of Christ.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “To every one of you, let me reaffirm my commitments to you and God Almighty. As your new Archbishop, I am here to lis­ten, to dialogue with you, to work with you, to lead by example and exhortation and to minister true service and sacrifice. POLL “My slogan shall be, let my light so shine before men, that they will see my good works and glorify the Father who is in heav­en”, Archbishop He said in his 11 years as a Prelate, the church grew in leaps and bounds and also in the areas of infrastructure. “Having lived a life of a Prelate for eleven and a half years, you will agree with me that we have indeed made tremendous prog­ress spiritually, and structurally in development as far as the Unit­ed Baptist Mission of Nigeria is concerned.
