BENIN  – The Edo State Investment Promotion Office has men­tioned oil palm, poultry processing and retail sec­tors as the most active sec­tors that have attracted lo­cal and foreign investments into the state in the last two years. Mr. Kelvin Uwaibi, the Managing Director, Edo State Investment Promotion Office (ESIPO) – Ease of Do­ing Business Secretariat, stated this in a chat with journalists in Benin City. He explained that be­tween 2021 and 2022, there were investments in the agriculture, food process­ing and energy sectors, stressing that some of the companies that had made substantial investments include Persianas Group, which he said was build­ing the Benin City Mall, on Sapele Road. “There is also Amo Farm Poultry Processing Plant located at Obayantor, Ikpo­ba-Okha Local Government Area (LGA) of Edo State. Fayus Oil Palm Company and Prime Agro Seed and other companies from Asia. “In the energy space, Ossiomo Power Plant in Ologbo has expanded and then we have two new refin­eries – one at Ologbo, Ikpo­ba Okha GRA and the other at Egbokor, in Orhionmwon LGA,” he added. Uwaibi noted that the investments had ensured that the state remained a good destination for in­vestors looking to expand their businesses in Nigeria, citing the availability of steady power supply from Ossiomo Power as a good incentive. He added that the Be­nin Port project, which is coming on stream, was expected to even attract more investments in the agriculture, maritime and ancillary sectors.
