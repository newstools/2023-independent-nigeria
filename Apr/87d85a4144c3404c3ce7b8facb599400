ABUJA – Mr. Gideon Onyedi, Founder/President of Diamond-Crest for Youth Education Foundation has said that those Nigerians who supported election violence against a particular tribe in the last general elections in Nigeria have no moral right to condemn the ongoing killings in Sudan. Onyedi pointed out that, “Those butchering other Africans on the streets of Khartoum and those who promoted violence and killing against people of other ethnic groups during the elections in Lagos are the same.” In a statement Onyedi issued in Abuja, he noted that ethnic cleansing and injustice meted out to a particular group or tribe could trigger a full-blown war in any society. According to him, “That is how it starts. War does not just start in one day. Ethnic cleansing does not start in one day. “Rebellion does not start in one day. It builds up overtime. Those who are in position to stop it but fail to do so have no moral strength to condemn it when it assumes a full scale in other nations.” He further advised Nigerians of all groups to come together and work with determination to accommodate everyone from anywhere in Nigeria. “Lust for power, greed and selfishness are the fertile grounds the breed war.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “If you want to convince a violent and murderous man that he is so, show him where his action is being displayed by another, he will end up passing a lethal judgement on himself,” he said.
