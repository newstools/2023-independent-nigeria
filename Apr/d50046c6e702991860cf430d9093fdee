LAGOS  – Forbes has released its comprehensive list of world’s billionaires for 2023 with Bernard Arnault‘s net worth surged by $53 billion to $211billion dollars since last year, a bigger gain than anyone on the planet, to climb to the number one spot for the first time ever on the rise of share in his company, LVMH. The list, which came out Tuesday, April 4th, with 2460 individual billionaires globally, has a couple of surprises as former world’s richest man, Elon Musk, slipped to second position after his worth reduced by $39billion due to his purchase of social messaging g app, Twitter. This is more so since the last year has been full of falling stocks, wounded unicorns and rising interest rates which translated into a down year for many of the world’s richest people. The 25 richest people in the world are worth a collective $2.1 trillion, down a combined $200 billion from $2.3 trillion in 2022. One of the surprises however, is the rise of BUA Group chairman Abdul Samad Rabiu, now $7.6billion a few months ago, the Billionaire businessman and philanthropist’s rating in Forbes billionaires list has again shot up towering many to become the 249th richest person in the world and closing in on overtaking the third richest man in Africa and Nicky Oppenheimer, who stands at $8.4billion Rabiu’s latest worth is put at 8.2billion dollars from $1.6billion Dollars in 2019, Forbes recorded that by 2022 his net worth was at 6.9billion dollars and from there has jumped to 8.2billion Dollars in April 2023. The 62-year old Abdul Samad Rabiu is essentially into cement and sugar as well as real estate and is building sub-saharan Africa’s second largest refinery and petrochemicals plant in Akwa Ibom, Nigeria. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Meanwhile Aliko Dangote has retained his position as the wealthiest person of African descent in the world. POLL Dangote, after climbing to 14billion Dollars in 2022, his wealth is estimated to be around 14.2billion Dollars as at the reports released on Tuesday April 4, 2023. He is presently the 125th richest man in the world and he is easily the largest cement producer in Africa. He also has his hands in other businesses including pastries, sugar and other areas of manufacturing. For Mike Adenuga, the third Nigerian on the African billionaire’s list, business has not been cosy. He dropped from $7.3billion Dollars in 2022 to $6.1billion. The last couple of years have seen him move up and down the wealthiest’ scale. He’s now the 418th richest in the world at 58. These are the only three Nigerians that made the list.
