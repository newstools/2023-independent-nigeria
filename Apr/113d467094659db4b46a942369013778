LAGOS  – A coalition of civil soci­ety groups and leaders of thoughts have called for the upcoming electoral cases in courts to be televised and for the judgments to be de­livered before the scheduled date of the swearing in of newly-elected polls winners. The group is also invit­ing Nigerians to sign up an appeal on comonvoiceng, a non-partisan platform built to enable citizens and consumers to express their views on issues concerning their lives to the government and corporations. In statement issued by a Professor of Strategy and Development and Direc­tor, Center for Advanced International Professional Studies (CIAPS), Anthony Kila, on Sunday, the group observed that “the recently concluded 2023 elections have left Nigeria in a very divisive state with a signif­icant part of the country considering the elections free and argue that election results reflect the wishes of the people while another significant part of the coun­try sees the elections highly flawed and considers the re­sults unacceptable and that the dualism is causing a lot of tension in the country.”
