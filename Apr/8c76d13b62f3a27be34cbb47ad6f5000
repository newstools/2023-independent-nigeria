AWKA  – There may be confrontations in Ogbaru Federal Constit­uency of Anambra State on Saturday, April 15, where a re-run has been rescheduled in 45 polling units scattered in Okpoko, Ogbaru and Ossoma­la communities. On Thursday, Governor Chukwuma Soludo charged top government functionaries led by the Political Adviser to the Gov­ernor, Alex Obiogbolu, who met with some stakeholders from Og­baru Local Government Area to take Ogbaru by all means. Further meetings were held between Soludo’s advisers and stakeholders from Ogbaru where they were threatened if the election is lost. At a meeting held at the office of the State Commis­sioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Matters, Hon. Collins Nwabunwanne, the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) chieftains agreed to make available wrist bands that would grant only APGA supporters unfettered access to the polling area, a source close to the meeting disclosed. Among those, who attended the meeting were the Director General of the APGA cam­paign in Okpoko area, Kenneth Akwuobi, popularly known as Okwulora; the Councilor repre­senting Ward 5, Frank Okorie; Chief Louis Ipere, Chairman, Nkpikpa Landlords Associa­tion; David Ezike, and one Ikpe, an Iyiowa resident. It would be recalled that at the end of voting on Saturday, February 25, 2023, the Labour Party (LP) candidate, Hon. Afam Ogene, led the APGA and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidates to second and third places, respectively. Although Hon. Ogene led both candidates by over 1,000 votes, it was not enough to de­clare him outright winner, as his margin of lead was smaller than the number of registered voters in units where elections did not hold within the federal constituency.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The affected polling units were those elections did not hold due to INEC’s inability to deploy materials as a result of violence while in some elec­tions were cancelled due to over voting, etc.
