LAGOS  – Dr. Kadri Obafemi Hamzat, La­gos State Deputy Governor has stressed the need for parents to train and guide their children in the way of God, stating that no nation can develop when its citizens are not well brought up. He stated this on Sunday while speaking at the 3rd memo­rial Ramadan lecture and prayer for late Oba Muftau Olatunji Hamzat in Lagos stating that there are lay down protocols in child upbringing which all must follow. “It is important the way we raise our children,” the lecturer said about contentment, even if you don’t let them know that they will always get everything they want, let them understand the essence of giving, sharing with others, being their friends’ keepers. if we can use it , I think it will be very beneficial to us Hamzat advised parents to always spend quality time with their children. “I think we real­ly need to spend some time with our children, let them under­stand the essence of life, what it means, what to be done and how things are to be done. If we don’t train them, somebody else will train them on the internet, some­body that they don’t know, some­body that doesn’t share their val­ues and they will just train them. So we just have to be very careful with our children, to instill our own culture, understanding, our own fibre into them so that they can grow up as our children and not internet children,” he said. Speaking on the essence of the lecture he said they hold the lecture because their father usu­ally organises such events when he is alive and also feeds the less privileged. “We just want to sustain it, even when he is no more alive, to assist people, bring people to­gether so that we can share ideas and assist ourselves to build our­selves and the society,” he added Alhaji Lateef Sunmonu, President, Ifako Ijaiye Muslim Community in his welcome ad­dress said their request for this year’s Ramadan lecture will be to ask Allah to direct our leaders right and make life easier for all of us.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
