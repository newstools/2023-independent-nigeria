The former Acting National Publicity Secretary of the LabourParty Mr Abayomi Arabambi and former Chairman of the dissolved Exco of LabourParty in Ogun State, Mr Michael Ashade recently suspended by their Wards and local government areas excos in Ogun State have been recommended for expulsion from the Labour Party by the Jagun Lookman-led State Exco of LP in Ogun State. Also recommended for expulsion by the State Exco for various anti-party activities after being suspended by their Wards and LGAs Excos are Mr Feyisayo Michael and Mr Tosin Ogunbona Meadows, Baba Seun Ogunyemi, MrsLizzy Oliseh-Samuel, former State Secretary, State Organising Secretary, StateAuditor, State Financial Secretary respectively. A statement made available to Daily Independent reads: “Their suspension and recommendation for expulsion, which was communicated formally to the National Secretariat of the party last week, were premised on various anti-party activities engaged in by Arabambi, Ashade and others to destabilise, factionalise and bring the party into disrepute acting as sponsored agents of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) ”The suspension and recommendation for the expulsion of MrArabambi, Ashade and their cohorts were made known today in a statement released in Abeokuta by Tokunbo Peters, the Publicity Secretary of the party in Ogun State. The statement further disclosed that before their eventual suspension, several warnings and cautions were given to make them refrain from their anti-party activities, especially through a peace and reconciliatory meeting which was mediated by a frontline elder statesman. However, rather than turn a new leaf, Arabambi and his cohorts became more recalcitrant and belligerent to satisfy their paymasters in the ruling APC. The statement added:‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “The Labour Party is not unmindful of the romance between the suspended members and the ruling APC Government in the State and the various attempts made by Arabambi and his cohorts to destroy the Labour Party from within. Amongst these is his role in ensuring that candidates of the Labour Party were not listed for any of the elective offices in Ogunstate in the just concluded elections and his sinister plot to remove some National Officers of the party from office through APC-sponsored ploy. POLL “The era when the Labour Party was used as a transactional platform for pecuniary gains by Mr Arabambi and his cohorts was over as the party under the able leadership of both Peter Obi and Julius Abure, the Presidential candidate and National Chairman respectively is now firmly in the grips of committed professionals and conscious youths, who have now repositioned the party as a formidable force in Nigeria and, therefore, can now favourably-compete for all elective political offices in the country. The statement reiterated the allegiance of the Ogun state chapter of the Party to Peter Obi its National Leader and Julius Abure its National Chairman.
