KANO – The Federal College ( Technical ) Bichi chapter of the College of Education Academic Staff Union ( COEASU) has declared an indefinite strike action over cocktails of challenges that centered on insecurity, non-remitting of the pension fund, poor students enrollment and amongst others facing the College. Addressing Reporters on Wednesday in Kano, Dr. Hussaini Yahaya Peni, the Chairman, FCE Bichi, COEASU explained that the strike is comprehensive and total, noting that the union was forced to invoke the last option of strike action given the college management’s lackluster attitude and the consistently high level of insensitivity to resolutions reached with the interventions of relevant stakeholders. Dr. Hussaini Yahaya Peni said the union considered as unfortunate the action of the college management in implementing the resolutions of 18th August 2022 and 10th January 2023 predicted on issue of quality academic standard and other emerging issues affecting staff welfare. He listed some of the contentious issues as “Non-payment of allowances from theories main stream and affiliate programmes (Degree Directorates and Centre for continuing education, lack of examination materials, poor lecture and hostel conditions and non supply of learning resources. Dr.Peni also listed insecurity and poor sanitation in the college and non release of impress and responsibility allowances were burning issues facing the institution. He however called on” the attention of critical stakeholders and prosecuting financial institutions to issues of mal- administration and financial recklessness from the management of our college” . This has greatly affected the academic standard of the institution saying that this great union therefore uses this medium to charge all local and international media organisations to prevail on relevant prosecuting financial institutions to constitute a high powered investigative committee to verify some of issues affecting the college.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
