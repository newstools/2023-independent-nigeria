General Yakubu Gowon, former Head of State and founder of Nigeria Prays has given a reason why he postponed the Prayer Rally billed to usher in the administration of Dr Alex Otti in Abia State, God’s Own State. The Prayer Rally, billed for Sunday, April 23, 2023 at the Master’s Vessel Church, Umuahia was expected to attract some dignitaries, top clergymen and women as well as the governor-elect, Dr Alex Otti. However, the programme was called off abruptly by the organizers. The Coordinator of the Nigeria Prays in the state, Apostle Chuks Alozie told our Reporter at the weekend in an interview that the General Yakubu Gowon suspended the programme because of the sharp criticisms the project attracted within Abia State and across the country. It will be recalled that apart from the state wing of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which expressed reservation over the visit of the former Head of State to prayer Alex Otti and others persons threw jabs at him. PDP subsequently asked him to apologize to the Igbos over his role in the Nigeria civil war, other personalities before coming to hold Prayer rally. Alozie, while regretting the inconveniences the suspension may have caused to those already invited, said the General and Nigeria Prays cannot be dragged into politics, adding that it was a genuine effort to usher in a new era in the state and not to support any person or political power in Abia State. “We will continue to pray and strive for the peace and unity of Nigeria, especially Abia State”, Apostle Alozie quoted the General to have said during the interview.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The governor elect, Dr Alex Otti, who won the March 18, 2023 governorship poll under the Labour Party, was to billed as the special guest at the Prayer Rally
