Operatives of the Bauchi State Command of Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) have arrested suspects in connection with the recent report of oil bunkering at Kainji Quarters, Gwallagar-Mayaka village in Bauchi Local Government Area of the State. The command’s Public Relations Officer (PRO), Ibrahim Abubakar Gabdo, who confirmed the arrest said the suspects were apprehended at the scene of the illegal bunkering. The command’s spokesman informed that the five suspects were nabbed with the jerry cans they used for their nefarious activity, adding that the jerry cans were filled already with stolen oil. He then said the suspects would be made to face the full wrath of the law as the Corps would arraign them before a court of law after completing its investigations. Meanwhile, the ward head of Kainji Quarters, Malam Salihu Ibrahim, has expressed worries over the inherent danger associated with oil bunkering and called on the relevant authorities to urgently repair damaged pipelines with a view to averting potential danger to lives and properties of the people of the community.Ibrahim told journalists that following recent damage to the pipeline carrying oil through the community, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Plc repaired the damage only for oil thieves to damage it again in less than a week to carry on with their illegal activities.
