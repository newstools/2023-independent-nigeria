The National Association of Nigerian Students in Sudan has called on the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) for a possible evacuation from the feuding country. This is contained in a statement issued by Gabriel Odu, Media, Public Relations and Protocols Unit, NiD­COM, on Thursday in Abuja. Odu said that the call was contained in a letter by the students to the commission. He said the commission received the letter of solicita­tion for possible evacuation, especially those in Khar­toum, the Sudanese capital. Earlier, Abike Dabiri-Ere­wa, Chairman, NiDCOM, expressed concern over the plight of Nigerian students in Sudan. Dabiri-Erewa said that the escalation of hostilities between the Sudanese Army and paramilitary group Rap­id Support Forces (RSF) was worrisome. The commission assured that the National Emergen­cy Management Agency (NEMA) in charge of emer­gency evacuations was con­sulting with the Nigerian mission in Sudan and other relevant agencies.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Dabiri-Erewa urged all Ni­gerian students in Sudan and Nigerians living in Sudan to be security conscious and re­main calm.
