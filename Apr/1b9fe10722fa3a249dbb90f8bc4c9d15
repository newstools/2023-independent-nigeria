Organisers of the Ethnic Business Awards-TEBA have begun preparations for the sophomore edition of the event aimed at hon­ouring foreigners and the migrant community in Ni­geria. According to Tunde Moshood, Convener of the awards ceremony, this year’s show will be held in Lagos on Nigeria’s Indepen­dence Day, Sunday October 1, 2023. In a press conference, the organisers disclosed that the amazing figures of foreigners and their economic contributions to the nation informed the need for the award celebra­tion. The organisation fur­ther noted that the Ethnic Business Awards, which debuted in 2020 is designed as an annual event, but the fears and jitters left behind by Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) hampered the project’s immediate conti­nuity. Moshood added that the aim of the award was to also bring together mi­grant communities with a view to celebrating their sense of unity and econom­ic contributions as well as to strengthen the mutual relationships between mi­grant community and host country. He also noted that the concept of the project in­cludes researching and appreciating promising and established foreign companies, migrants com­munity and ethnic individ­uals of sterling qualities, they will be identified and grouped into different cate­gories via a public opinion poll, research and consul­tations for the purpose of the awards ceremony/pre­sentation· “We have created catego­ries like The Ethnic Man Of The Year; an award that goes to an outstand­ing migrant/naturalized male who aside being an employer of labour or busi­ness leader has also built a rapport and contributed to other communities most especially the host society. There’s also The Ethnic Woman of The Year; who’ll be considered worthy of the memento in the same vein.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “Other categories are Auto Company of The Year, Ethnic Financial Institution of The Year, Household Appliances Company of The Year, Electronics Company of The Year, Ethnic Group of The Year among others.
