***Appeal To Guber Candidates To Join Hands With Oborevwori To Build A Greater Delta State The Chairman, Youth Wing of Urhobo Christian Ministers Association, Pastor Tareri Avwomakpa Esq., has urged Deltans and the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party to protect the mandate freely given by the votes of majority of Deltans Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori, Governor-elect of the state. Avwomakpa in statement on Sunday, advised that a Mandate Protection Committee of experts be setup to secure the mandate freely given by Deltans. According to Avwomakpa who is also a member of Sheriffied Lawyers, the committee when setup would help to protect and secure Oborevwori’s mandate from the attacks of some who may decide to explore other options including the Courts to attack the mandate. “I call on all contestants in the just concluded Governorship elections in Delta State to eschew bitterness and join hands with Sheriff Oborevwori to build the greater Delta which they desire. While congratulating Oborevwori on his election as the governor of Delta State, Avwomakpa noted that the INEC has also reaffirmed that mandate by presenting a certificate of return to him. “It is now time to move on; it is time for work, time for all the needed support to the incoming administration. We urge all the aggrieved politicians to set politics aside and give Rt. Hon. Sheriff Francis Orohwedor Oborevwori all the support he needs. I enjoin them to withdraw all the cases already instituted in court”, he added.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
