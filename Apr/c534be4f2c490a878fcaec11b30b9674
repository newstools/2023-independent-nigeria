ABUJA – Prince Clem Ikanade Agba, Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, has called on Christian faithful and Nigerians to take the opportunity of the Easter celebrations to pursue peace with one another. Agba, in a goodwill message issued on Good Friday, also urged Nigerians to love one another. He pointed out that Christ’s love, which made Him surrender His life on the cross at Calvary for the remission of sin of man, was the essence of the season. He said it was only in the atmosphere of peace and love, which the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ represented that “we can unleash our creative potential for the development of our nation.” Agba urged all and sundry to “focus more on issues that unite rather than divide us as a nation.” According to him, “There is no limit to the amount of collective good that can accrue to a united nation. I urge us to be united in focus and in pupose.” “I wish all of us a momentous Good Friday and celebratory Easter Sunday and Monday in the abundance of love, peace, and unity. Shalom!”‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
