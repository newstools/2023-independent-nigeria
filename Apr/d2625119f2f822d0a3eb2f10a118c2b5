WTO members on 20 April shared perspectives on the current practice of not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions. In the fourth of a series of dedicated discussions held this year under the Work Programme on Electronic Commerce, members highlighted the need for more exchanges on issue of the e-commerce moratorium, focusing in particular on its definition, scope, and implications on developing countries. Indonesia shared its perspective on the e-commerce moratorium and presented its draft regulation containing provisions on the imposition of customs duties on electronically transmitted digital goods. Singapore presented its submission on the wider economic and social benefits of the moratorium on businesses and consumers, in addition to its fiscal implications and impact on development. Members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) — Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines — presented a submission sharing their considerations of the impact of the moratorium on the growth and development of e-commerce.  They urged more focused discussions and detailed analysis on the issue. Ambassador Usha Dwarka-Canabady of Mauritius, the facilitator of the Work Programme on Electronic Commerce and the e-commerce moratorium, welcomed members’ exchanges on the issue and noted that a workshop involving relevant international organisations will be held on 1-2 June 2023. This will be an opportunity for members to discuss the themes of the four thematic sessions conducted under the Work Program so far covering the moratorium, the digital divide, consumer protection, and legal and regulatory frameworks.
