ABUJA – All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) reinstated National Chairman, Edozie Njoku, has written to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), seeking implementation of the Supreme Court’s judgment of Friday 24th March 2023 which declared him the party’s authentic head. In the said judgment, the Apex Court reinstated Njoku in a ruling that saw it putting to rest the leadership tussle between Victor Oye and the former, and clarified that the earlier disputed verdict by former justice of the Supreme Court, Mary Odili, was a ‘mere’ clerical error. Justice Odili in a previous judgment on the party’s leadership struggle inputted the name of Oye as the party’s national chairman; though this has since been invalidated by the respective appellate court, and now the Supreme Court. APGA’s national secretary, Muhyideed Imam, in a statement, said that “the Supreme Court in its judgment resolved conclusively the APGA leadership dispute in favour of Chief Edozie Njoku as the undisputable Chairman.” It noted that his purported removal as National Chairman was declared null and void by the apex court. “The statement noted “It is important to note that the forwarding letter was written to the Chairman of INEC and all the National Commissioners of the commission with copies to: “Mr Taninu Inuwa (SAN)‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Director, Litigation and Prosecution POLL Legal Department, INEC, Mr Abdulazeez Sani (SAN) Chief Legal Officer, INEC and El Hassan Umar (SAN) Chief Legal Officer, INEC. “The letter forwarding the certified true copy summarized the 42-page judgment of the Supreme Court highlighting the critical pronouncements of the court and consequential orders as follows: It needs to be stated at this point that the dispute being who should be the Acting National Chairman of the 1st Respondent, APGA and whether the Chairman, Edozie Njoku was validly replaced are within the confines of the internal affairs of the 1st Respondent which is not justiciable.”
