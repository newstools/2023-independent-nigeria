A Federal High Court Judge sit­ting in Abuja on Wednesday sen­tenced Umar Hussaini, a lawyer to the late Comptroller General, Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Abdullahi Dikko, to seven years imprisonment with an option of fine. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, in a judgment, found Hussaini guilty of the two-count charge preferred against him by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Com­mission (ICPC). After Justice Ojukwu convict­ed Hussaini, two witnesses, one of whom was a legal practitioner, Mr. Amobi Nzelu, testified about Hussaini’s good character, while praying to the court for leniency. They begged the court to give the sentencing with an option of fine as the convict was said to have four wives with children, aging parents and was said to be the breadwinner of the family. He also begged the court to temper justice with mercy and sentence him with an option of a fine. He said he had never cheated anyone or committed any crime before and that the responsibility of discipline and catering to the children was on him. Naziru Umar, the convict’s lawyer, broke into tears while pleading on behalf of his client for mercy.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
