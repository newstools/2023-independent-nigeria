The Ogun State Govern­ment has been alerted to the clandestine plans by some mischievous and disgruntled elements who have mapped out plans to constantly generate lies and libelous publications, fake and slanderous news against the governor and the state government, and its principal officials. The devilish plan was hatched at a meeting held recently by the governor­ship candidate of a leading opposition party that lost out in the recent governor­ship election in the state, a former Commissioner for Special Duties in Ogun State and the state secretary of the said party. The meeting took place at a popular hotel in Abeokuta owned by the candidate’s father where they resolved to engage yellow journalists and blackmail bloggers to em­bark on serious mudslinging against the governor and gov­ernment of Ogun State and its principal officials. This pull-him-down scheme, the state government said, also involved two former gover­nors of the state and was be­ing bankrolled by a popular pools magnate. “We urge members of the public to be wary of these talebearers, agents of false­hood and their sponsors who have decided to toe this devil­ish path, having realised the growing popularity of Gov­ernor Dapo Abiodun after his re-election and the futile attempts being made to stop him. “In the same vein, let it be noted that the rule of law will unfailingly be brought to bear on anyone that pub­lishes fake news against the governor and government of Ogun State with intent to defame the administration, cause disaffection and create crisis in the state. The Ogun State Govern­ment reaffirms that its du­ties and obligations are to the people and residents of our dear Gateway State and no amount of fake news and evil machinations or politi­cal gangsterism will deter it from taking Ogun State to greater heights and leaving the state better than it was met by Prince Dapo Abio­dun.
