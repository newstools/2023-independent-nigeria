According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, Lazio have offered a new contract to Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, but Arsenal hope to make the Serbia international their ‘gift’ for the Premier League title, although Newcastle United have a higher budget. SMS’ contract at the Stadio Olimpico expires in June 2024 and Lazio are eager to extend with the Serbian star. According to Gazzetta, Lazio President Claudio Lotito has offered a new €4m-a-year deal until 2026 with a release clause of 60m. The midfielder’s agent Mateja Kezman seems unwilling to continue talks with the Biancocelesti knowing that his client has attracted interest from several clubs in Serie A and around Europe. Juventus and Milan are the Italian clubs keeping a close eye on the 28-year-old, but it remains to be seen if the Bianconeri and the Rossoneri will have the financial resources to persuade Lazio. Milinkovic-Savic has plenty of admirers in the Premier League. Arsenal ‘want to make themselves an important gift if they win the title,’ wrote Gazzetta correspondent Andrea Ramazzotti but Newcastle ‘have already spoken to Kezman’ and have a higher budget. West Ham are also mentioned as a potential destination for the Serbian midfielder, given that the Hammers may need to replace Declan Rice in the summer. However, Kezman said in August that he wants his client to join a club playing Champions League football, which is why he didn’t listen to offers from Arsenal and Newcastle less than a year ago.
