With the recent call for an Interim Government by some political gladiators in the country, vocal and respected youths from the north under the umbrella of Arewa Youth Assembly have stated that such call for Interim government could led to political uncertainty. Frowning at such a call/suggestion for an Interim Government, the Arewa Youth Assembly expressed its strong opposition to such calls in Nigeria, saying, “We believe that such a move is not in the best interest of our nation and could lead to further instability and political uncertainty. In a press statement signed and made available to Independent by the group’s Speaker, Mohammed Salihu Danlami, the group stated that, “As a Youths Organization committed to the unity and progress of Nigeria, we are deeply concerned about the recent calls for an interim government to take over from the current administration. We believe that such a move would be unconstitutional and could set a dangerous precedent for our democracy. According to the statement, “The Arewa Youth Assembly is of the view that since the 2023 general election was fair and credible due to the introduction of BVAS and winners emerged, there is nothing that should warrant the calls for the formation of Interim National Government. We believe that supporting the transition program of the present government while taking advantage of the Courts to seek for the redress is the best way to ensure political stability and continuity in Nigeria. “We also urge all stakeholders to engage in constructive dialogue and work towards finding solutions to the challenges facing our nation. It is only by working together that we can build a strong, united, and prosperous Nigeria for all. While calling for support from Nigerians for the current administration and the President Elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the group urged Nigerians to work towards a better future for our nation and a better Nigeria that we will all be proud of. The Arewa Youth Assembly reiterated that it strongly opposes any move to enforce an interim government in Nigeria.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
