BENIN  – Greg Ewah, an Edo State-based legal practitioner, has charged Mr. John May­aki, a former aide to Gover­nor of Edo State to quit the “diabolic and unwarranted obsession” with Governor Godwin Obaseki, and focus on building a decent career. Ewah, who decried the recent jibes at the governor by Mayaki over the recent recognition by the World Bank, alleged that the ex-aide was pained because he was sacked over his incom­petence over seven years ago. He also said that the for­mer aide to the governor was yet to get over his sack. He said: “It is quite cu­rious that Mr. John Maya­ki has made attacking the Governor his day job. He was sacked as Interim Chief Press Secretary (CPS) and has never gotten a decent job ever since. After hob­nobbing with the opposi­tion for crumbs and staging laughable Public Relations (PR) stunts for his immedi­ate family members, he will always make a roundabout turn to obsess with the governor and issue watery stations. He would then pro­ceed to make demands that are way above his station. “In the eyes of the right-thinking members of the public, his actions would appear petty and in­fantile, but it is disturbing that Mayaki doesn’t see it as such. He thinks he is on top of the world. “While many in the state were overjoyed over the in­vitation extended to Gover­nor Obaseki to present the successes of the education reforms in the state at the Spring Meetings in Wash­ington DC, USA, Mayaki was busy manufacturing lies and making shameful demands from the World Bank.” He noted that the reforms being undertaken in the state were to the benefit of every child in Edo, includ­ing relatives of Mayaki, but instead of appreciating these transformational pol­icy changes, he chose to play petty politics.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He called on the members of the public to disregard the tantrums from Mayaki, reiterating that he needed to find a decent paying job to sustain himself.
