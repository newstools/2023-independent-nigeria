inDrive, the global mobility and urban services platform, has announced the launch of inCode 2023, the company’s first annual global hackathon. This hackathon seeks to award €16,000 for the top ideas to make ride-hailing safer and more inclusive. inDrive is inviting the world’s leading tech talent to register teams of 1 to 6 people, with entries judged by inDrive experts based on the idea, impact, code quality, UX/UI quality, and feasibility. inCode 2023 challenges innovators to discover ways to make ride-hailing safer and more secure for all, propose methods to make ride-hailing more inclusive for people with disabilities, and determine what factors or features are currently missing from inner and inter-city trips and the delivery of goods, and discover ways to use technology to improve these services and solutions. The hackathon will be held in two phases, starting with Phase 1 from April 20 to June 4, 2023, during which participants will submit their ideas and general concepts in the format of PowerPoint/ Keynote presentations. Phase 2 will begin from June 19 to July 9, 2023, during which participants will deliver their prototypes to compete for the prizes. The best prototypes in the three categories will win prizes of €750, €1.500, and €3.000, respectively. Alexander Lobashev, Senior VP of Engineering, inDrive, commented on inCode 2023, stating that; “Ride-hailing platforms owe their very existence to the creativity and technical expertise of software developers and coders’ ability to dream up, design, and build global products, reliable algorithms, and user-friendly interfaces. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ inCode is a way for inDrive to recognize the tech innovators who invest their time and talent to make ride-hailing safer, more inclusive, and better.
