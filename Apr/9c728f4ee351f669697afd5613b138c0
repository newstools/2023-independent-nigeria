LAGOS  – The Rural Electrification Agency (REA) says it hopes to implement projects better, leverage successful projects to create more opportunities for the private sector, align with the private sector to pilot and scale viable projects and unlock private capital through public funding. The agency’s desire stems from the successful implementation of projects across the country in 2022,it said in a report. The report said that it is expected that livelihoods, specifically in rural communities, will be impacted through programs that provide electricity for productive use in healthcare centers, markets, schools, agriculture, etc., in a sustainable and impactful manner. According to the report, in 2022, six communities were equipped with a 100-kW solar mini-grid system. It explained that the systems were designed to prioritize productive users, including agro-processing businesses, homes, commercial users, as well as public spaces. ‘’Over 8,155 lives and 5,000 active farmers have been impacted with uninterrupted power supply and clean affordable water, translating to over 60 direct and indirect jobs created, improved security, increased productivity, improved healthcare, as well as the decommissioning of over 40 diesel and petrol gen sets. Based on the current and future estimations, the reductions in carbon emissions were also encouraging,’’ the report said. It further disclosed that 1,392 irrigation solar pumps were distributed across the six geopolitical zones, reaching 1,300 male and 92 female beneficiaries, as well as about 200 farm clusters. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
