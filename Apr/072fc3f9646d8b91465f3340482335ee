ABUJA – Yusuf Gadgi who represents Pankshin/Kanke/ Federal Constituency in Plateau State, has announced that a political support group, South Eastern Democratic Union, is behind him in his bid to become Speaker of the 10th Assembly of the House of Representatives. While adding that he possesses the capability and expertise required to hold the office. Gagdi has distinguished himself by his track record of performance in key legislative duties and constituency projects over the last four years of his time in the House of Representatives, according to a statement from the group signed by its Secretary-General, Dr. Emma Onwuatuegwu. It, therefore, appealed to all stakeholders to support him to become the next speaker of the House of Representatives in order to deliver good governance and development to Nigerians. The group said: ‘’Gagdi is the youngest candidate in this contest so far. He is in his 40s but understands the Legislature. In his first and only term in the House of Representatives, six bills that he sponsored or co-sponsored became law, signed by the President. This has never happened since 1999 and this is his first and only term as a federal lawmaker. He sponsored or co-sponsored 18 bills altogether and 6 were passed into law in a parliament that it takes an average of 2 and a half years to pass a single bill. That is evidence of his understanding of the legislature and how to make parliament work. ‘’He is a very effective constituency operator. The projects and empowerment he has done for his constituents place him high above every other member of the House, except for Speaker Gbajabiamila. He has touched lives of the youths, elderly and women in many ways including education sponsorship and water provision. ‘’He has excelled in his primary function of lawmaking, in the function of advocacy, he has done well and in the unique function of constituency projects, he has also performed credibly.’’‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
