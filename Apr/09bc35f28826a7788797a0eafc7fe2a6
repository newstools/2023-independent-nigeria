The Kremlin has said the killing of prominent war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky was a “terrorist act” and has arrested 26 year-old Darya Trepova in connection with the bomb plast that killed him. Ms Trepova was arrested on Monday in connection with the bombing in a cafe in St Petersburg that killed Max Fromin, better known as Vladlen Tatarsky, while he was giving a talk to an audience of about 100 people, Russia’s Investigative Committee said. On Monday, the Kremlin said the killing of Mr Tatarsky was a “terrorist act” and cited Russia’s Anti-Terrorism Committee in saying that there was evidence linking Ukraine to the assassination. An explosive device, containing more than 200 grams of TNT, was hidden in a bust that was gifted to the blogger by the suspect prior to the explosion, according to Russian police. A witness, named Alisa Smotrova, said that a woman who identified herself as Nastya asked questions and exchanged remarks with Tatarsky, according to Sky News. Ms Smotrova quoted Nastya as saying she had made a mini statue of the blogger but she had been asked by guards to leave it at the door, suspecting it could be a bomb. A joke followed before she then went to the door, grabbed the bust and presented it to Tatarsky, Ms Smotrova said. Tatarsky reportedly placed the bust on a nearby table, and during his talk the explosion followed.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ At least 32 people were injured in the blast, 10 of them seriously, while 19 casualties were being treated in hospital, according to Russian state media. POLL Tatarsky had more than 560,000 followers on Telegram, and was one of the most influential military bloggers providing commentary on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
