YENAGOA  – Several youths of Bayelsa State on Wednesday carried out a solidarity walk in sup­port of the second-term bid of Governor Douye Diri and his deputy, Lawrence Ewhrud­jakpo, in Yenagoa, the state capital. Wearing different brand­ed T-shirts and faze caps embossed with the images of Diri and Ewhrudjakpo, and chanting solidarity songs, the youths, numbering over 4,000, commenced the 15-kilometer walk from the Etegwe-Edepie Roundabout and terminated at the Peace Park, opposite the Government House, where they all gathered. Diri had on April 12 emerged as the governorship candidate of the Peoples Dem­ocratic Party (PDP) at its pri­mary election in Yenagoa to contest for second tenure at the November 11, 2023 gover­norship polls. He was the only aspirant for the party’s ticket during the exercise. At the event, many youths who defected from the oppo­sition All Progressives Con­gress (APC) publicly dumped the party’s symbol of broom and were officially received by the state secretary of the PDP, Gesiye Isowo, who hand­ed them over to the governor. The governor’s Special Ad­viser on Political Matters, Col­lins Cocodia, said the youths were delighted with the skills and empowerment schemes of the administration and decided to stage the solidar­ity walk as a demonstration of their appreciation to him. “They are of the firm be­lief that you (Governor Diri) are doing well and also taking good care of them. Just yes­terday, you empowered a lot of them. And they felt that this morning they will have a walk to say ‘a very big thank you’ to you. They have felt the positive sides of the Prosper­ity Government and they are very comfortable. They are of the firm belief that for one good turn, you deserve anoth­er one,”he said. Addressing the youths, Diri said his administration had a covenant with the youths of Bayelsa to take de­velopment to all parts of the state while entrenching peace and unity, and implementing programmes for the prosper­ity of the people.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
