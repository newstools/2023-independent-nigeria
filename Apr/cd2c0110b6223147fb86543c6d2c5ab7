President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has announced he would like to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss a potential solution to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The president is on an official trip to Spain where he participated in a business forum held in Madrid on Tuesday, April 25. During his speech at the event, he reiterated his criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukrainian territory, referring to it as an “insane war.” “Brazil is committed to seeking partners so that we can promote peace, Ukraine can keep its territory, the Russians can keep Russia, the world does not suffer from lack of food, the world does not suffer from lack of fertilizers, and the world can prosper again to generate the jobs that humanity needs,” he added, reinforcing the concern with the food and energy crises caused by the war. According to Lula, he has personally dealt with the issue with Germany’s Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and with the presidents of the United States, Joe Biden, and China, Xi Jinping, and by phone with Macron himself. Our attempt, said Lula, is to “build a movement that will bring peace back to our beloved Europe so that we don’t have nightmares every night about the possibility of a 3rd World War or the use of nuclear bombs. “The key to avoiding such a catastrophe is to exercise wisdom and seek a common ground for achieving peace,” he stated. The president has also discussed the matter with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez.
