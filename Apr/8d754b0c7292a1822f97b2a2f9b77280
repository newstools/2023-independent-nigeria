LAGOS  – The President of the African Public Relations Association, APRA, and CEO of CMC Connect, Yomi Badejo-Okusanya has called on public communicators against politics of discrimination in the continent. The call was made recently while speaking to Journalists about the recent elections in Nigeria. Badejo-Okusanya urged the candidates and their supporters to remain guard against tribal or ethnic sentiments, especially after the election. According to him, Nigerians need to eschew ethnic sentiments and inciting remarks that could lead to violent confrontations. Rather, they should assess candidates vying for political offices based on their ideas, character, competence, and capacity, it said. “There should be no place for racial, ethnic or tribal sentiments in an election which should be based on ideas, character, competence, and capacity.” “There can be no justice without equity and fairness. Many of us ought to be thoroughly ashamed of the conduct of some public figures and the roles they played in the gas-lighting.” “Now that the elections have come and gone, victory is declared, we are looking for sincere healing through mutual respect and constructive engagements. We should condemn certain narratives capable of undermining peaceful coexistence and National security.” ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
