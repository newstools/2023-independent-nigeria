LOKOJA  – A Non-Governmental Organi­sation (NGO), Doyin and Suzan Foundation, has distributed food items to over 400 vulnera­ble widows in some rural com­munities in Isanlu, Yagba East Local Government Area of Kogi State. The NGO’s Founder and Executive Director, Chief Mrs. Adedoyin Ibikunle-Eshanumi, while flagging off the distribu­tion in Isanlu, said the gesture was to reach out to the less priv­ileged people in her area during the Easter celebration. She said the death and resur­rection of Jesus Christ signified God’s passion, sacrifice and love for mankind, hence the need to extend the same love to the vul­nerable in the society during the Easter celebration.

The philanthropist urged other NGOs, well-spirited indi­viduals and corporate organi­sations to emulate Christ’s love to man­kind by reaching out to the less priv­ileged in the society.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ She advocated for a better social welfare for the less privileged especial­ly at the grassroots.
