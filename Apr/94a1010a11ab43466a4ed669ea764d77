President of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Joe Ajaero, has urged the Fed­eral Government to use the Easter festivities as a period for building bond and reconciliation across the nation. In a statement by the NLC President on Satur­day, he said the death of Jesus Christ on the Cross marked by Easter offers us all a chance for deep reflec­tion on the virtues of the greatest love and sacrifice and of undying hope. He said: “In light of this, we urge Nigerian workers, indeed all Nigerians to im­bibe the virtues of Easter through manifestation of the spirit of love through forgiveness, sacrifice, hope and sincerity. “We similarly urge Ni­gerian leaders at various levels of leadership who brought upon us this level of pain, privation and ac­rimony to not treat these virtues as platitudes but core values for healing, re­building, and repositioning of the country. “It is important to note that Jesus died a pain­ful death on the cross not pleasing the establishment of the day but challenging it to do the right thing. “In like manner, we at the Nigeria Labour Con­gress owe it not only a mor­al obligation to continually remind the government of its duties and obligations to the people, we will sensitise the people to their rights. “We shall resist any at­tempt to criminalise our hard-earned right to peace­ful protest against the ills perpetrated by operators of the Nigeria state. “In the spirit of Easter, and in line with our pro­test tradition, we make bold to state that we have the capacity and the will to protest peacefully against wrongs by government when necessary. We simi­larly urge all Nigerians to protest within the ambit of the law when they feel short-changed. POLL “Finally, we urge the Christian faithful and their neighbours to celebrate the Easter in peace.”
