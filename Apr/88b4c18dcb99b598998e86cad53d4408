Large-scale food fortification has been identified as a major instrument to address the high rate of malnutrition and under-nutrition especially in a country with a population as large as Nigeria. Adesuwa Akinboro, Country Director, TechnoServe, stated this while speaking at the second edition of the Micronutrients Fortification Index (MFI) awards during the 2023 Nigeria Agrofood and Plastprintpack conference in Lagos. She said the MFI is designed mainly to incentivize private sector companies to fortify their products for three main reasons – public recognition, providing a level playing field for all companies to ensure fortification compliance and incentivizing companies to improve and maintain high fortification standards. Products of Flour Mills of Nigeria (FMN), Raffles, PZ Wilmar, Crown Flour Mills, Olam and Dufil made the top 10 of the 2023 MFI and were recognised by TechnoServe for their contribution to food fortification. “Today we are recognising private companies that have adhered to fortification standards and maintained improved food fortification compliance levels,” Akinboro noted that TechnoServe through its market-based and industry-led Programme – Strengthening African Processors of Fortified Foods (SAPFF), worked with partners to redefine the unsatisfactory narrative of large-scale food fortification in the country. According to her, SAPFF has since evolved into the Technical Assistance Acceleration Programme (TAAP) project, which is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to work with global supply chain partners in the food fortification space to create a platform for private-public partnerships that will drive sustainability of large-scale fortification. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
