The Nigerian Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists recently lamented the toll that decades of medical tourism by Nigerians, especially the political class, has taken on the country’s health sector and the economy at large.Although the planned 2023 budget allotted more than 1 trillion naira for the sector, for the first time in Nigeria’s history of financing the health sector, more funding is needed.An analysis of the budget proposal presented by President Buhari shows that N1.17 trillion of the total N20.5 trillion for FY2023 was allocated to the health sector.If the enormous sum of money wasted on medical tourism had been put into the nation’s health sector, AMLSN lamented, Nigeria would have become a tourist destination. Other effects of this issue include a sharp increase in brain drain and significant losses of scarce foreign currency.Nigeria spends over N664 billion years on medical tourism, and in 2022 alone, there would be a loss of human capital equivalent to 906 medical laboratories and scientists.To date, almost all of Nigeria’s best minds are in the US, UK, or other developed or developing countries, making scientific inventions and other breakthroughs for their host country. For example, to practice medicine in the United States, you must be one of the best doctors in the world.Nigeria has been plagued by a brain drain in the health sector for years. As highly skilled health workers continue to leave the country in search of better opportunities abroad, the doctor-to-patient ratio in health facilities continues to decline, overwhelming available staff.Not surprisingly, in February 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that Nigeria was one of its 55 countries suffering from a shortage of health workers.Exacerbated by the brain drain, the country’s current Universal Health Care Index (UHC) is below 55, with a global median health worker ratio of 49 doctors, nurses, and midwives per 10,000 of her population. are below Skilled workers are forced into exile due to poor working conditions, low wages, high levels of economic injustice, and escalating security problems.Most often they are attracted to the incentives available in developed countries, partly because of better compensation packages, working conditions, medical aid and improved quality of life.The 5.75% allocated to health in the proposed budget is up from the 4.7% allocated in 2022, but health experts are confident that the government is doing the right thing and will meet the agreed 15%. It says it needs more support to make sure it exceeds.However, the federal government is encouraged to seek to increase the health budget to 15% of the federal budget to ensure public health security, as recommended in the Abuja Declaration.It also requires the appropriate and timely release of funds to the health sector to meet the country’s National Development Plan goals related to health care. To ensure accountability, the timely release of health budget implementation reports must also be ensured.
