ABUJA – Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general election, Atiku Abubakar has implored the electorate in all the places where supplementary elections will take place on Saturday to come out in large numbers to cast their ballot for the PDP. Atiku, in a statement by his Media Adviser, Paul Ibe, specifically calls on the voters at polling units where elections will take place in Adamawa and Kebbi on Saturday, 15 April, to ensure that the process of electing PDP state governors and federal and state lawmakers in those states and others are completed in a peaceful manner. “In both Adamawa and Kebbi where supplementary elections shall be held on Saturday, I wish to make a special appeal to the voters in the respective polling units where elections shall be taking place to make sure that the PDP enjoys overwhelming support through their votes. “It is an established fact that the APC has failed the people of this country and, especially, in Kebbi State, the more reason it is incumbent on the electorate to vote them out and return the PDP,” Atiku said. It will be recalled that after the February 25 and March 18 general elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) scheduled supplementary governorship elections in Adamawa and Kebbi states, five senatorial districts, and 31 federal and 58 state assembly constituencies across the country.
