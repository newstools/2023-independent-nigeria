LAGOS – Union Bank of Nigeria Plc has released its audited financial statements for the year ended 31st December 2022, revealing strong financial performance despite macroeconomic headwinds. The bank’s profit before tax grew by 47 per cent to N30.2 billion as against N20.5 billion posted in 2021. Profit after tax rose by 51.2 per cent to N29 billion from N19.2 billion. Gross earnings went up 19 per cent to N208.2 billion from N175.0 billion posted in 2021, driven by strong growth in Net Interest Income. According to the bank in a statement, Net Interest Income rose by 33 per cent to N59.1 billion from N44.3 billion in 2021 driven by growth in earning assets while Net Operating Income after impairments was up 10 per cent to N110 billion from N99.7 billion in 2021. This is on the back of increasing inflation which the economy continues to struggle with. The headline inflation rate rose to 22.04 per cent in March, a 0.13 per cent increase from the 21.91 per cent rate recorded in February, according to the latest report published by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Friday. The report said the increase was buoyed by the jump in prices of food, housing, fuel and gas, among others. The figure shows a consistent increase in the inflation rate for the last two years. On a year-on-year basis, the headline inflation rate was 6.13 per cent points higher compared to the rate recorded in March 2022 which was 15.92 per cent. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Union Bank noted that Operating Expenses marginally grew by 0.4 per cent to N79.4 billion from N79.2 billion in 2021, reflecting tight cost control despite inflationary pressures. POLL Commenting on the results, Mudassir Amray, MD/CEO said that despite the macroeconomic headwinds of 2022, the bank recorded strong performance across key financial and operational indicators. “We were focused on our strategy of deepening our core business segments whilst enhancing our digital channels and service propositions to customers. On the back of this, we are increasing our customer acquisition and engagement, translating into higher revenues across our regions. The bank’s gross earnings grew by 19 per cent to N208.1 billion from N175 billion in 2021. “Whilst non-interest income declined marginally by 1.0 per cent, net interest income after impairment grew 26.1% to N55.8 billion from N44.2 billion in 2021 on the back of increasing responsible risk assets. Profit before tax closed at N30.2 billion, representing a growth of 47.1 per cent from N20.5 billion recorded in 2021. In 2023, we will remain focused on executing our strategic initiatives, which are centred on pursuing additional opportunities to diversify our revenue sources while strengthening our core business. We also look forward to completing the merger of Union Bank of Nigeria and Titan Trust Bank, which began in 2022.
