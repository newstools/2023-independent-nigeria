ABUJA  – The presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, on Thursday through the Head of the Obi-Datti Media, Diran Onifade, dismissed ru­mours surrounding his ordeal with immigration officials in Heathrow Airport, London, saying that contrary to reports the British government is yet to apologize to him. He stressed that he was yet to receive any letter of apology from the British government over his airport harassment in the UK. Daily Independent reported that Obi was detained in London on April 7 over alleged imper­sonation. However, on Thursday re­ports started circulating in a sec­tion of the media that the British authorities have apologised. But in a swift reaction to the development, the Head, Obi-Dat­ti Media, said, “We have been re­ceiving enquiries with regards to a so called apology, purport­edly issued by the British gov­ernment or any of its agencies, to our principal, Mr. Peter Obi, in respect of a routine Immigra­tion engagement with him, as he arrived London, for a brief visit, last Friday, the 7th of April. “We would like to state em­phatically that we are not aware of any such apology, and have not issued any statement what­soever, in that regard. “While we continue to ex­amine any dubious or political motive, on the part of the perpe­trators of the identity theft, we have every confidence in the ability of the British authori­ties to resolve the matter to its conclusion”.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ According to him, Obi has since moved on from the inci­dent and continues to be totally focused, on the legal processes before the Election Petition Tri­bunal towards the recovery of their mandate, which they are convinced was overwhelmingly expressed by voters in the presi­dential election of February 25.
