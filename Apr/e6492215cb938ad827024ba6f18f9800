KANO – Alhaji AbdulMajid Danbilki Kwamanda, a member of the defunct Buhari Organisation(TBO) on Saturday said the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Senator Barau Jibrin, is the north’s choice to lead the 10th Senate. Danbilki Kwamanda, a long-standing ally of President Muhammadu Buhari who spoke with newsmen in Kano weekend on a number of issues declared that Northwest deserved the Senate President to ginger national cohesion. The tough-talking Buhari’s ally explained that it was politically wrong for either the South-South or South-East to clamour for the number 3 position in the land against the backdrop of the 2023 electoral successes of the All Progressives Congress. Kwamanda stressed that “They didn’t work for us, they were against the Muslim-Muslin ticket, and now that the ticket has sold out, they are trying to blackmail everyone “. Speaking further, the Buhari ally made reference to President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan era where the President was a Christian, the Senate President, David Mark, Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu and Madam Patricia Eteh were Christians. He maintained: “It is time for the North, even in the North, it is time for Barau Jibrin to be the Senate President. This is our choice and is what we are calling for”. AbdulMajid Danbilki Kwamanda noted that this past political development didn’t weaken the diversity; adding that the north’s clamour for Senator Barau Jibrin’s senate presidency would strengthen Nigerian diversity.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Kwamanda therefore, enjoined the National Chairman of the Party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu to jettison zoning arrangements in respect of principal officers of the National Assembly. POLL He maintained that “the north has spoken. What’s before us now is Barau Jibrin Senate Presidency and the region would mobilise to actualise it”.
