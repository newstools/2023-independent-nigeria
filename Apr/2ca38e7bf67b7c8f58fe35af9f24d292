As a way of confronting the lack of inclusion of people with disabilities, Goethe Institut’s Head of Library and Information, Georges Gambadatoun, is leading this year’s Kultursymposium project, by staging ‘The Gods Are Strange’. Written by Bukola Ayinde and directed by Nnamdi Agbo and Michael Ajimati, ‘The Gods Are Strange’ tells the story of a community in crisis. They seek the help of the gods, only to receive a shocking directive. Instead of choosing the most able-bodied men, the gods call upon a warrior, a blind boy, and a dancer to solve their problems. The community questions the gods’ wisdom in selecting this odd trio. Ayinde, the author of the play, urges the play’s cast, production team, and audience to reflect on the central role of unlikely individuals in a community’s salvation and to consider the implications of the negative conceptualizations we carry about people living with disabilities on the fate and future of our society. As an activist and advocate for a more inclusive Nigeria, Ayinde has observed the hushed quality of public dialogue as it relates to people living with disabilities. She says that the creation of the play serves as a platform to depict the mind of the Nigerian society as she has experienced it. “I want everyone to know that no matter who you are, you have been given a gift that the world needs, and that we need to respect each other. We need to include everyone, and we need to work in unity for the good of our community.” The play, which is being performed by KININSO Koncepts, a renowned theatrical production company, was staged at Jardin Reading Garden, Jos National Museum Premises on April 21st. It’s next showing is at Yenagoa Road, Agbara Estate, Ogun State on May 5 at 12 noon. As a way of walking the talk and ensuring inclusiveness, a disabled student plays the role of the leader of the village dancers. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
