The Lagos State government has intervened in bringing solutions to the egg glut con­fronting poultry farmers in the state. The state through the Min­istry of Agriculture has facil­itated the off-take of a mini­mum of 300,000 eggs from the Erikorodo Poultry Estate in Ikorodu by a private firm – Farm Alert Limited. After weeks of visits and negotiations by the state’s Commissioner for Agriculture, Abisola Olusanya, and other se­nior ministry officials towards ensuring that all parties are in agreement to modalities of the off-take, the operations com­menced on Monday. She said that the support from the state government shall further enhance the development of the poultry value chain in Lagos. Olusanya stated that the Sanwo-Olu’s administration will continue to put measures in place to create a conducive environment for farmers to operate in line with efforts to ensure sufficiency in food production in the State. She added that Sanwo-Olu has championed the food system transformation plan with the overall objective of improving the livelihood of the agricultural value chain actors towards wealth cre­ation, job security, increased inclusiveness in sectoral pol­icy formulation with a view to the production and supply of wholesome nutritious foods to Lagosians. However, the poultry farm­ers operating in Erikorodo and Aiyedoto poultry estates form a large percentage of registered farmers under the Poultry Association of Nige­ria (PAN) – Lagos State chap­ter, and the move enhances the food security agenda of the state government.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The estates’ poultry farm­ers stated that the recent egg glut issue was aggravated by cash crunch, closure of schools, amongst other fac­tors.
