***Wishes Muslim Faithful Joyous Celebration ABUJA – The Department of State Services (DSS) has arrested two gunmen in Kano, on Thursday with two AK-47 assault rifles, two empty AK47 magazines, a red boxer motor cycle and sack of yams in which the guns were concealed. Dr. Peter Afunanya, the Services Spokesperson told INDEPENDENT in a statement that, the “suspects were on transit to deliver the arms for a planned attack in one of the States in Northern Nigeria. “This development underscores the need for citizens to be extra vigilant and report any unusual or suspicious movements, persons or acts to the security agencies nearest to them. Operators and patrons of fun, hospitality and tourism centres are enjoined to be cautious during the festive periods. They should scale up measures to ensure safety of their facilities.” However, the Service wished the Muslim faithful, peaceful and joyous Eid al-fitr celebrations. It pledges to work with sister agencies and other stakeholders to emplace adequate security during and after the events.
