Matthijs de Ligt’s brilliant strike gave Bayern Munich victory at Freiburg and kept them top of the Bundesliga. The Netherlands defender crashed a screamer into the top corner from 25 yards from Jamal Musiala’s ball. Freiburg, who knocked Bayern out of the German Cup on Tuesday, had big chances with Ritsu Doan hitting the post and Yann Sommer denying Roland Sallai. Borussia Dortmund remain two points behind Thomas Tuchel’s leaders after a 2-1 win over third-placed Union Berlin. Donyell Malen gave Dortmund the lead with Kevin Behrens levelling, before 18-year-old Youssoufa Moukoko came off the bench to score the winner. Bayern have won the past 10 Bundesliga titles and beat Dortmund 4-2 last weekend to overtake their rivals as leaders. (SOURCE: BBC)‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
