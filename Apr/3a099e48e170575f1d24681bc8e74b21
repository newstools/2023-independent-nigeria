LAGOS – President Muhamma­du Buhari has urged Nigerians all around the country to contin­ue to be confident and believe strongly in the country for bet­ter seasons ahead. He made the call in his 2023 Easter message to Nigerians while joining Christians in Nigeria and around the world to celebrate Easter, which commemorates the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, signposting his victory over death. According to the President, “At the heart of Easter, is the triumph of light over darkness. It is a season that reminds us that the Almighty can turn an unpleasant situation around for good.” President Buhari further added that “recognising that Easter is about renewed hope and a glorious future, I urge all Nigerians to continue to be con­fident and believe strongly in our country for better seasons ahead. “As a nation, we have gone through an election that has produced the next set of leaders at the federal and state levels. I commend Nigerians for believ­ing in the process. “While I congratulate those that have been elected, I ac­knowledge that it is the right of those who feel dissatisfied with the outcome to seek redress. I expect them to wait patiently and allow our legal system to run its course.” At the coming end of his tenure, he nostalgically said, “It has been a rare privilege for me to serve as your President since you gave me the first mandate in 2015 and renewed it in 2019.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “Day after day, I have been guided by the vows I took to keep Nigeria united, prosper­ous and secure. Our successes in security, economy, infra­structure, new oil frontier ba­sins, landmark legal reforms as well as food sufficiency, among others, were possible because of the support of Nigerians. POLL “As we celebrate this season with our families, neighbours and communities, let us do so in love, compassion, kindness, resilience and forgiveness.”
