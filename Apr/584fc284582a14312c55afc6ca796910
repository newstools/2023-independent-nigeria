Rangers are being inked with a loan move with Barcelona prospect Pablo Torres. The 20-year-old midfielder was seemingly a target for the Light Blues last summer after slamming 12 goals in 32 games for Santander but the player was then the subject of a €5million move from the Catalan giants and could not resist the opportunity to go to the Nou Camp. However, the talented star has found it hard to get game time under coach Xavi with just 11 appearances overall and only three starts for Barca, two in the Copa del Rey against lower league opposition and one against Viktoria Plzen in the Champions League. He has yet to start in La Liga for the champions elect. Now the player’s representatives have met with Barcelona hierarchy and he will now go on loan. Other Spanish sides are interested, but Rangers are in the frame. Mundo Deportivo report : “Despite only a few minutes with the first team, Pablo Torre is still a valued player and an old suitor could resume interest in the midfielder if Barca’s exit door opens. “We are talking about the Scottish (side) Rangers , a team that already tried to sign Pablo Torre last summer but the footballer ended up opting for the Catalans’ proposal, who paid five million euros to Racing Santander to get him to join. Rangers have been successful this season with the loan of Malik Tillman, Bayern Munich’s attacking midfielder who has scored 12 goals in 40 games, and could repeat the formula with Pablo Torre according to the latest information.” Tillman, of course, could sign on permanently at Rangers for next season but the fee is believed to be over £5million.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
