Being the text of a statement issued by Archbishop Daniel Okoh, President, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) titled ‘Easter Reflection: The Power that Gives A New Beginning’ as Nigerians celebrated Easter last Sunday. As Christians around the world celebrate Easter this year, I would like to draw attention to the power that gives a new beginning that this season represents, and the lessons that Nigeria as a nation can learn from it. Easter is a time of hope and renewal, a time when we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the power that gives a new beginning. It is a time when we reflect on the sacrifices that Christ made for us and the new life that his resurrection represents. As a nation, Nigeria has faced many challenges in recent years, from insecurity and economic instability to social and political unrest. However, just as Christ rose from the dead and brought new life to the world, we too can rise above our challenges and start afresh. This Easter, let us all come together and renew our commitment to building a better Nigeria. Let us embrace the power that gives a new beginning and work together to create a brighter future for ourselves and our children. Let us put aside our differences and come together in unity, just as Christ’s resurrection brought together people from all walks of life. As we celebrate Easter, let us also remember the less fortunate in our society and extend a hand of love and kindness to them. Let us show compassion to those who are suffering and help to lift them up. In conclusion, I urge all Nigerians to take inspiration from the power that gives a new beginning that Easter represents. Let us come together as one people and work towards a brighter future for our nation. May God bless Nigeria and grant us peace and prosperity in abundance.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
