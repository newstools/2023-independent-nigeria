ABUJA – The President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has asked the Presidential Election Petition Court to dismiss the petition by the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the February 25, 2023, presidential election, Atiku Abubakar, for lacking in merit. Tinubu submitted that the petition by Atiku and PDP against him is a gross abuse of court process adding that the petitioners have no right to present this petition, having peremptorily filed an Originating Summons at the Supreme Court on 28th February, 2023, praying the Apex Court to assume original jurisdiction on the same subject of their petition, and asking the court to nullify the entire presidential election. He therefore asked that the petition be dismissed for lacking in merit, substance, bona fide, sincerity and for also being frivolous, vexatious, highly misconceived, disclosing no reasonable cause of action and for constituting a crass abuse of the judicial process. In the defence filed by his counsel, Chief Wole Olanipekun SAN, Tinubu asserted that it was not a surprise or by accident that the electorate rejected the 1st petitioner (Atiku) at the polls of the presidential election held on 25th February, 2023. At the presidential election conducted by INEC (1st respondent) on 25th February, 2023, Tinubu claimed that having polled 8,794,726 votes across Nigeria (which was the highest amongst the 18 candidates at the election), and also satisfied all other requirements, he was validly returned as President-elect of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The former Lagos State Governor argued that Atiku had since 1993 consistently contested and lost elections both at the primary and general elections. Tinubu described the former Vice President as a serial loser and an unstable politician”.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Tinubu traced the history of Atiku’s loses in the presidential election to 1993 when he reportedly lost the Social Democratic Party (SDP) primary election to the late Chief M.K.O Abiola; and in 2007, when he lost the presidential election to the late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua. POLL Other elections Tinubu cited Atiku lost are in 2011, when he lost the Peoples Democratic Party presidential primary election to President Goodluck Jonathan; in 2015, when he lost the APC primary election to President Muhammadu Buhari; in 2019, when he lost the presidential election to President Muhammadu Buhari; and in 2023, when he has again, lost the presidential election to him. Justifying his own victory, Tinubu claimed.to have always been a most consistent politician, who has not shifted political tendency and alignment while the 1st petitioner (Atiku) has consistently crisscrossed different political parties of Nigeria, including being a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) before joining the Action Congress in 2007, when he was the presidential candidate of the party; returned to the PDP thereafter, before joining the APC in 2015, where he contested the primary election with President Muhammadu Buhari, before returning to the PDP in 2019 toemerge as its presidential candidate. Tinubu claimed that while he had alwayscarried his supporters along and increased his political followership, Atiku has lost most of his followers in the process of moving from one political party to the other. In the 2023 general elections, Tinubu alleged that the emergence of Atiku as the presidential candidate of the 2nd petitioner (PDP) led to irreconcilable hostilities within the ranks of the party, causing the emergence of a group of Governors known all over the country as the G-5 Governors- Rivers, Oyo, Enugu, Abia and Benue, who opposed the 1st petitioner and vowed to mobilise their people against him. “Atiku as the 1st petitioner could not even campaign or canvass for votes in some ofthe States controlled by the 2nd petitioner, including Rivers and Oyo States where the 2nd respondent (Tinubu) defeated the 1st petitioner (Atiku) by a wide margin. “The 2nd petitioner (PDP) does not have any right whatsoever or howsoever to be returned as duly elected at the election held on 25th February, 2023, having lost to and/or been beaten/defeated by the respondent. The 1st petitioner, having lost at the election of 25th February, 2023, has no right to and cannot be declared as the winner of the election under the Nigerian laws. Moreso, Tinubu explained that while Atiku contested the presidential election of 2019with President Muhammadu Buhari under a fairly cohesive Peoples Democratic Party with Peter Obi as his running mate and Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso as one of his supporters, the same Peter Obi broke away from the PDP to join the Labour Party to contest the presidential election of 25th February, 2023, while Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso also broke away from PDP to contest the presidential election on the ticket of the New Nigeria People’s Party. He said that while Peter Obi polled a total number of 6,101,533, Rabiu MusaKwankwaso polled 1,496,687.“Before the balkanisation of the 2nd petitioner (PDP), the South-Eastern States of Enugu, Abia, Imo, Ebonyi and Anambra used to be controlled by PDP but at the presidential election of 25th February, 2023, they all went the way of Labour Party“At a Press Conference addressed by the 1st petitioner (Atiku) on or about 2nd March, 2023, he admitted the negative impact of the balkanisation of the 2nd petitioner on the fortune of his election, particularly, the exit of Peter Gregory Obi from the party.“As between the 2nd petitioner (PDP) and the 3rd respondent, (APC) while the 3rdrespondent is a national party, popular amongst Nigerians, cutting across all divides, the 2nd petitioner has, in the past years, been engrossed in intra-party irreconcilable feuds and infighting, both in relation to its national offices and officers, as well as the Convention which producedthe 1st petitioner (Atiku) as its presidential candidate.“Presently and from 2015 till date, the 3rd respondent APC, has been the political party in power in Nigeria; it presently has the President of the country, 20 State Governors, 64 Senators, 217 members of the House ofRepresentatives and about 600 members of the States’ Houses of Assembly, nationwide; while the 2nd petitioner has just 14 StateGovernors, 39 Senators and 111 Members of the House of Representatives.“In the election that held on 25th February, 2023 and 18th March, 2023, while the 3rd respondent produced 15 Governors, as against 9 of the 2nd petitioner, it also produced 64 Senators, as against 33 produced by the2nd petitioner, and 217 Representatives, as against 104 produced by the2nd petitioner. 20.Tinubu promised to lead evidence to prove and demonstrate that from 1999 till date, it has been the consistent pattern that the politicalparty who controlled/controls most of the States as well as the National and State Assemblies produced/produce the President, and that the election of 25th February, 2023 was no exception.“This is asides the misfortune and calamities that have befallen the 2nd petitioner in recent years, even till after the election, where they had to sack their National Chairman. The respondent shall found and rely on documents and newspaper reports of the various squabbles in the 2nd petitioner.
