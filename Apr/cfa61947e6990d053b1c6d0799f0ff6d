Mavin Records, one of the leading record label in Nigeria, celebrated last month’s IWD with a series of women-led initiatives. One of the activities organized included a boot camp for fifteen female creatives consisting of independent artists, sound engineers, songwriters, and producers. During this boot camp, the participants were exposed to state-of-art facilities and facilitators in partnership with AudioGirl Foundation led by Febe Adedamola. At the camp, the participants were lectured on the music business and how to thrive in different fields, especially male-dominated ones. During this period, they were equipped with lessons that would last them a lifetime during their career. Mavin also held its annual Mavin IWD Soiree providing a creative, fun and safe space for women in the entertainment industry to gather and discuss the issues that affect them collectively, and birth solutions too. This year’s Soiree was a gathering for these women to let their hair down, network, walk in the pride of all they have achieved, and have other women hold their hands with the hashtag #takeoffthetag. During this year’s month long IWD celebration, Mavin also partnered with Spotify to host and thrill guests with performances from artists such as Qing Madi, Crayon, and Magixx. Beyond these events, Spotify led a Masterclass and a panel session where female executives discussed and spearheaded DigitAll- Innovation and the importance of tech in the music business. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
