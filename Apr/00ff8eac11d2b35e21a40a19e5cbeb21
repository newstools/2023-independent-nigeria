Arsenal striker Folarin Balogun, who has impressed on loan at Sta­de de Reims this season, is now on RB Leipzig’s shortlist as they look to sign a replacement for Christopher Nkunku, according Florian Plettenberg. Nkunku has long been expect­ed to join Chelsea in the summer for over €60 million after sourc­es told ESPN last September that the club arranged for him to undergo medical tests. Since then, the 25-year-old forward has shown his quality by recording 17 goals and five assists in 27 match­es across all competitions despite sustaining an injury that kept him from representing France at the World Cup. Balogun, 21, has also dis­played what he can do in front of goal, scoring 19 Ligue 1 goals this term, meaning there has been plenty of interest in his services from across Europe. One thing that would go in Balogun’s favour regarding Leipzig is that his re­ported €30m transfer fee could be lower than Lille star Jonathan David, who has also been linked with the Bundesliga side. There has also been intrigue over which national side Balogun could represent. Born in New York, he is eligible to play for the United States and visited Orlando during the international break af­ter dropping out of England U21s’ latest squad due to injury. In addition to Balogun’s pend­ing decision at the international level, there will be plenty of ques­tions to answer regarding his fu­ture at club level once the current campaign ends.
