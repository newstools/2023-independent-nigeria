The Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (EVC/CEO) of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta, has reiterated the Commission’s commitment to continually drive initiatives that accelerate broadband deployment to increase penetration and make internet connection readily available to telecom consumers. The EVC stated this at the 10th edition of Business 360 Clinics organised by Abuja Enterprises Agency (AEA) in Abuja. Speaking on the theme of the event, “Technology Utilization and Innovation: Effects on SME Profitability and Productivity” in the context of the regulatory activities of the Commission, the EVC, who was represented by Assistant Director, Digital Economy, NCC Paul Okeke, noted that NCC has been at the heart of providing the digital drive for transforming businesses and sustaining socio-economic activities in Nigeria. During the panel session titled “Technology Adoption: A must for MSMEs Sustainability and Competitiveness (Challenges and Ease of Use),” Okeke highlighted the Commission’s commitment towards technological and digital transformation in a manner that makes entrepreneurship seamless. While addressing the issue of challenges on digital literacy, Okeke informed the audience that the Commission has strategic partnerships with various organizations including the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) which birthed initiatives such as Digital Economy Academy where businesses owners learn about security risks and online threats in a 12-course programme for 3 months. Okeke charged entrepreneurs to leverage technology to harness the benefits of these initiatives to sustain their businesses. “As a regulator of Telecommunication, the Commission is in active collaboration with other agencies in the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, as well as with other public sector institutions such as the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) to ensure that policies become effective in curtailing cyber-attacks and threats on businesses,” Okeke stated.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ The participants and business owners also seized the opportunity of the platform to make complaints and resolve their business-related challenges while adopting technology for their various businesses during the interactive session.
