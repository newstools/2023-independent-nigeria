The Department of State Services (DSS) has inter­cepted guns concealed in a sack of yams in Kano and arrested two suspects. The suspects were reported­ly on transit to deliver the arms preparatory to a planned attack on one of the Northern states when they were arrested. A release Thursday by the Spokesperson of the Service, Dr Peter Afunanya, said two AK-47 rifles and two empty AK-47 mag­azines were intercepted. Afunanya said red boxer motorcycle and a sack of yams where the guns were concealed were also intercepted by the op­eratives. He called on operators and patrons of fun, hospitality and tourism centres particularly hoteliers to beef their security during Eid-el-Fitri period. Afunanya said, “This devel­opment underscores the need for citizens to be extra-vigilant and report any unusual or sus­picious movements, persons or acts to the security agencies nearest to them. “Operators and patrons of fun, hospitality and tourism cen­tres are enjoined to be cautious during the festive periods.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “They should scale up mea­sures to ensure safety of their facilities.” POLL However, the Service wishes the Muslim faithful, peaceful and joyous Eid El-Fitr celebra­tions. “It pledges to work with sister agencies and other stakeholders to emplace adequate security during and after the Ramadan celebrations.”
