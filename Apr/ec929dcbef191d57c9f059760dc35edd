The incoming government in Kano will revisit the dethronement of Alhaji Muhammadu Sanusi, 14th Emir of Kano, the Presidential Candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) and leader of the Kwankwasiyya Movement, Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso, has said. Sanusi was dethroned on March 9, 2020, by outgoing Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, who was deputy governor to Kwankwaso at the time the monarch was installed. After his dethronement, he was banished from Kano and sent to Loko, a remote community in Nasarawa State. Kwankwao, speaking in a viral video, said the dethronement and balkanisation of the emirate would be reviewed by the government of Abba Kabir Yusuf, the governor-elect, who is popularly known as Abba Gida-Gida. “We have campaigned and as you know we are popular in Nigeria, especially in Kano state, we are now back and God willing we will continue with the good works our administration left. This incoming governor and his team will take them up.” “As elders, we will continue to advise them to do the right thing. We tried not to intervene in the issue of bringing or removing any Emir, but now, an opportunity has come. “Those who were given this opportunity will sit down and see to the issues. They will look at what they are expected to do. Besides the Emir, even the emirate has been divided into five places. All these need to be studied. Usually, a leader inherits good, bad and issues that are hard to reconcile.”He said in the viral video.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
