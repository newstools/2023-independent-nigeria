IBADAN  – Waste Contractors in Oyo State have sent a save-our- souls mes­sage to the Governor Seyi Ma­kinde over what they described as counterproductive approach to waste management which they said is capable of truncating the huge investment and efforts of the government in ensuring a clean and green Oyo State. The waste contractors re­called that it was the collective­ness and genuineness of pur­pose of waste collectors across the state that earned the former governor, late Abiola Ajimobi, the title of Aare of Atunluse of Ibadanland from the then Ol­ubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Soliu Adetunji Aje Ogunguniso I The waste contractors noted that they have refrained from speaking up on the matter for a long time with the hope that the situation was going to abate but noted that things now appear to be getting worse despite the commitment of the Makinde government to ensure a clean and green environment across the state. They said many waste contractors were already going out of business not on ac­count of inefficiency and service delivery but high handedness, indebtedness to waste contrac­tors, unreasonable charges and job insecurity. Speaking with journalists We­nesday in Ibadan, the Oyo state capital, some of the aggrieved waste contractors lamented that the approach and operations of the waste consultant, Mottainai Recycling company, engaged by the state government had continued to frustrate them from helping the government to achieve the desired results. They said except Governor Ma­kinde is determined to personally sit down with critical stakehold­ers and waste contractors in the state in a roundtable where all the rots in the system would be unravelled to him directly, there might be no hope in sight to achieve the desired results. Some of the issues raised by the waste contractors needing urgent and direct intervention of governor Makinde include but not limited to compelling payments of all charges directly into the bank account of Mottain­ai Recycling company; the waste consultant in charge before the consultant decides on what per­centage goes to government and what comes to them. They also noted that despite members reluctantly complying with the new policy in the spirit of trust and faith in Governor Makinde, the approach has be­come seriously exploitative be­cause many members who have delivered services and incurred huge operation costs were yet to get payments for services provid­ed which according to them now runs into several months despite payments of monies generated from waste collection into the Consultant’s bank account.
