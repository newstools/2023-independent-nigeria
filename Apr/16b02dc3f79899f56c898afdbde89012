Harry Kane sits top of Man United’s transfer shortlist this summer, but Bayern Munich have also been linked with the striker. Bayern Munich’s chief financial officer has admitted Harry Kane could be out of the club’s price range during this summer’s transfer window. The Manchester Evening News revealed last month that Erik ten Hag has earmarked Kane as Manchester United’s prime striker target, with the club needing to strengthen the attacking options due to the current lack of firepower in the team. Marcus Rashford has scored 27 goals in all competitions this season, but away from the academy graduate, who predominantly plays on the left side, there has been a concern at others’ failure to play their part in front of goal. Wout Weghorst, who has scored two goals this season, was a stopgap option signed on loan in January and Anthony Martial is the only recognised striker on a permanent deal at Old Trafford but his record with injury is poor. As he enters the final year of his contract with Tottenham, Kane is considered a solution in the transfer market by Ten Hag, however, Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has a preference for not selling the player to a direct Premier League rival. Bayern Munich need a centre-forward and have been linked with a transfer to Kane, but the German club’s chief financial officer Dr Michael Diederich has thrown a move for the 29-year-old into doubt by citing the club’s limitations in the market.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ When recently asked about a potential summer move for Kane, Diederich said: “I don’t rule anything out but can we afford such a transfer and do we want such a transfer? We have to keep an eye on our profitability.” POLL Kane has 23 goals in the Premier League this season, which means only Manchester City’s Erling Haaland has scored more. The striker intended to leave Tottenham in 2021 but a move away was blocked.
