LAGOS  – This year’s Nigeria Liquefied Petroleum Gas Limited’s Science Quiz Competition will focus on climate change and net zero emission goals. It is in partnership with the Rivers State Ministry of Education and the Science Teachers Association of Nigeria (STAN), Rivers State Chapter. It will test students on their knowledge of the theme, which is in line with the Company’s quest for a sustainable environment, and open to students in senior secondary school classes, SS1 and SS2, from government-owned secondary schools in the three senatorial districts in Rivers State. The winners from the first stage will compete in the Championship stage in April 2023 and the winners from that stage will compete in the Grand Finale in May 2023 for the SS2 category. Winners in the SS1 category will be determined in the Championship stage, a statement said . NLNG’s General Manager, External Relations and Sustainable Development, Andy Odeh, said the competition aims to encourage passion for science and technology among young students. He also said that it was important for the themes to address pressing global issues such as climate change and net-zero emissions to help develop the students’ scientific skills and knowledge and help them understand the impact of their actions on the environment. “Incorporating the theme of climate change and net-zero emissions in the science competition can have a significant impact on children’s attitudes and behaviours towards the environment.” ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
