The commissioner further explained that while the transition committee by the outgoing government prepares final handing over report, the committee by the incoming administration will eventually receive the report at appropriate time. He stated that the inclusion of representation from the incoming government was based on the need to ensure transparency and openness in the process. Malam Garba added that since the outgoing government is having all the relevant data and information at its disposal which the transition committee is gathering, the incoming government needs the least representation in the committee, just as it obtains in other states where transition is between different political parties.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He noted that the aim of the transition committee was to prepare a handing over from one government to another and not presenting or promoting any form of ideology.
