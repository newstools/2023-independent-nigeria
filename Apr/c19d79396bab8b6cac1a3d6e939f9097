The Rector, Federal Polytechnic Ado Ekiti, Dr. Temitope John Alake has enjoined Christians to be moderation and pray for peaceful and wellbeing of the country as they celebrate Easter. Dr. Alake gave this admonition  while felicitating with Christian faithfuls on the occasion of this year’s Easter Celebration. Specifically, Dr Alake charged the Polytechnic community not to lose sight of the lessons and sacrifices, which are the hallmarks of Easter, but reflect on their individual and collective roles at ensuring and sustaining peace and unity in the Institution. The Rector equally  admonished all to go out, spread the good news and extend a hand of kindness and fellowship to the less privileged around them. He called on everyone to pray for peaceful coexistence in the Polytechnic and Nigeria as a whole, as growth and development can hardly be attained without peace and  unity of purpose. Alake  urged them to use the period of the celebration to reflect on Christ’s sacrifice and give thanks for the love and peace He brought to the world. The Rector however, advised all to enjoy the festival and the Easter holidays in moderation in view of the state of economy and the nation, as well as the spirit of the season.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
