ABUJA – On Tuesday, the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) officials issued a stop-work order to the developer of an ongoing estate in the Gaduwa neighborhood of the nation’s capital due to encroachment. Murktar Galadima, the Director of the FCT Department of Development Control, who led other top department officials on the exercise, claimed that the developer did not follow the prior approved plan for him and instead expanded the work to the green space. He said despite the ‘stop work ‘ order, after marking the illegal structures, the developer failed to comply with the several notices served on him Galadima hinted that, the administration will not permit developers to disregard the Abuja master plan in the name of city growth. He also ordered another developer on Oladipo Diya road, still within Gaduwa area to stop work over an unapproved development. According to him: “There is a large encroachment of 33metres here, we gave them notice, we marked the structure and we served them all the relevant notices but they failed to comply with our notices, because expectedly when we serve you notice, you are to stop until all investigations are concluded.” POLL‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “It is what we call +688 which is meant for recreational park but then, they encroached on some certain amount of spaces.But since they are contesting our decision, we have called surveyors to re-investigate the whole site because most likely there is shift on ground from the original space allocated so that we can confirm.People should not go beyond their boundary, and they should always build or develop with what is in line with what has been approved for them”. Meanwhile, the Project manager of the site, Engr Chidi Godwin, alleged that there was an approval given to them by the officials of the FCTA. He acknowledged that Private and FCTA surveyors carried out the exercise separately. “We are not going to contest the position of the FCT Administration after reviewing the survey”, he said.
