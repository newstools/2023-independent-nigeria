YENAGOA – Bayelsa State Governor Douye Diri on Thursday arrested two herders and their cattles at the Sampou junction along the East-West Road in the Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area of the state. The governor stopped his convoy to apprehend the herdsmen for breaching the state’s anti-open grazing law. This was contained in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah. He directed security agencies to clamp down on violators of the state’s anti-open grazing law. Recently, there was apprehension in the state following the killing of farmers in Biseni and Zarama communities in Yenagoa Local Government Area allegedly by herdsmen. He expressed anger that despite several warnings, some persons were still brazenly flouting the law against open grazing in the state. “On March 10, 2021, the Bayelsa governor signed the “Livestock Breeding, Rearing and Marketing Regulation Law, 2021,” Diri said.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He stated that henceforth, law enforcement agencies must ensure that they apply the full weight of the law on violators. POLL The governor directed the state’s Chief Security Coordinator, Gen. Eric Angaye (rtd), who was also in the convoy, to ensure the arrested herders were prosecuted to serve as deterrence to others. Earlier, at a meeting on Thursday with the Arewa community in the state, youths of Yenizue-Epie community, traditional rulers and some stakeholders in Government House, Yenagoa, he restated the position that the ban on open grazing was still in force.
