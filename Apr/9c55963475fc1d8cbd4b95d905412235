The Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, has said he had extracted a commitment from the contractors handling the Kara end of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway that the part of the road would be completed and open to traffic on or before Sunday, April 30, 2023. According to The Punch, Abiodun disclosed that he got the commitment on Friday from the contractor through the Federal Comptroller of Works when he had an on-the-spot assessment on the cause of the constant gridlock on the road which had been causing the people discomfort. “On Friday, I stopped at Kara and made a piece of my mind known to the contractor handling the Kara end of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, my stopping there was with respect to the very poor traffic management and the resulting traffic gridlock subjecting innocent travellers to untold hardship. “I am glad to note that I was able to extract from the firm handling the construction of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway through the Federal Comptroller of Works a commitment to complete the construction causing the bottleneck on or before Sunday 30th April and open the road to allow free flow of traffic both outbound and inbound Lagos,” he said.Abiodun, however, expressed optimism that the commitment he extracted from the contracting firm would go a long way toward ensuring that the persistent gridlock affecting road users on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway becomes a thing of the past. He urged road users plying the road to be a little patient with the government as the road is about to be opened to vehicular traffic. The road was flagged off by former President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan in 2013 at a cost of N167 billion naira and contracted to Julius Berger Nigeria Plc and Reynolds Construction Company Limited respectively. The road was expected to be commissioned before the end of the administration of the President, Muhammadu Buhari.Go‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
