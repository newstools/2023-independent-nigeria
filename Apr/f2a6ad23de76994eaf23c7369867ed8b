MINNA – Niger State Governor-elect Hon. Umar Mohammed Bago yesterday inaugurated a 71- Member independent Transition Committee, under the chairmanship of the deputy Governor-elect, Comrade Yakubu Garba to take stock of assets and liabilities of the, Abubakar Sani Bello-led administration. This is coming against the backdrop of fears that the incoming administration may have set in motion plans to probe the eight years of Governor Bello-led administration. The committee’s terms of reference is to amongst others; take stock of all outgoing prospects, liabilities, and assets and as well advise the incoming government appropriately on how to transform the state better than it is today. Inaugurating the Transition and Secretariat committees at the Legbo Kutigi international conference centre, Minna Thursday, Umar Bago charged the two committees to ‘make their findings clear to the public so that upon their exit too, they shall be judged accordingly’. “Our intentions are clear not negative or personal, but in the interest of Nigerlites because posterity will surely judge us”, Bago said, adding that so doing would give the in-coming administration a clear direction of areas that needed attention in the making of a better Niger state in the nearest future. The committees, according to Bago are expected to interface with state government officials in a view to understanding the financial status of the state, economically and otherwise, hence they are expected to probe deeply into the position of all government books, transactions as well as commitments therein. Meanwhile, there are palpable fears among key government functionaries that the yet-to-be-inaugurated administration may have started probing some of the alleged financial recklessness of the Sani Bello-led administration.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ POLL Some key stakeholders who spoke on the condition of anonymity told our correspondent that the binding chord is beginning to give way, the no love lost between the incumbent and the incoming Governor which almost cost the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) the state is beginning to manifest.
