The Gombe State chapter of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has expelled former Governor Danjuma Goje over alleged anti-party activities. The party also suspended the lawmaker representing Gombe South in the Nation­al Assembly, Bulus K Amos, and a House of Represen­tatives member, Yunusa Ahmad Abubakar, from the party. Goje is a lawmaker rep­resenting Gombe Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly. Announcing his expul­sion after a closed-door meeting by the Kashere Ward Executives, the Ward Chairman, Tanimu Abdulla­hi, said the action was in line with Article 21 subsection (1), (2) and (3) of the party constitution as amended. He said Goje was earlier warned through a letter of his anti-party activities. Abdullahi added that when Goje was invited by the five-man committee to investigate his activities during the last general elec­tions, he refused to honour the invitation. “During the election, some of Goje’s supporters were caught warning peo­ple not to vote for any other person in APC other than Senator Danjuma Goje. We warned them to stop their actions but they did not heed our warnings.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “Consequently, I, on be­half of the entire members of Kashere Ward, hereby expel Senator Danjuma Goje from the party,” he said. POLL Also, the party, in a state­ment by Gombe Publicity Secretary, Moses Kyari, said Amos was suspended by the ward executives of the APC in Bambam Ward of Balan­ga Local Government Area. According to him, Sen­ator Amos was suspended over anti-party activities during the general elections.
