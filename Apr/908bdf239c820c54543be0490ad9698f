LAGOS  – The Lagos State Public Works Corporation has assured Lagosians of its continued presence on Lagos roads to address various forms of road defects as the rainy gradually sets in. This assurance was given Tuesday by the General Manager of the Corporation, Engr. Lateef Somide during a tour of some of the sites of ongoing road maintenance work at Itire-Lawanson Road, Surulere, Orishigun Street Ketu and Agbowa-Itoikin Road. Somide noted that it is common knowledge that Lagos has experienced torrential down pour recently which has slowed down the intervention of the Corporation in fixing bad portions of roads. This, he said has also resulted in upsurge in the emergence of pot-holes on many roads in the state, especially those that are due for total reconstruction as such roads have outlives their span. The General Manager however said that under the Babatunde Sanwo-Olu administration, the agency’s operations have been configured to maintain presence on Lagos roads in all seasons, adding that ‘’that is why you will see our men fixing the roads even in the rain with interlocking paving stones as the hot asphalt premix normally used is not suitable for wet season’’. He said further that in order to minimize the challenges posed by bad roads to free movement of persons and goods during the wet season, the Agency ensures that palliative intervention are carried out with the use of boulders on portions that are almost degenerating into craters while the use of cold mixed asphalt and interlocking paving stones are also employed either as palliative or outright fixing of some roads, depending on the terrain. According to him, the corporation swiftly deployed it’s men to many parts of the state immediately the rains abated so as to rapidly fix the pot holes, using hot asphalt premix through both day and night operations. “We are taking full advantage of the dry weather witnessed so far in the past one week to treat many defective road portions day and night,” he added.
