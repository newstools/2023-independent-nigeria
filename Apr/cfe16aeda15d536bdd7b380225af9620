Memmuchi has returned with a new song titled “Money and Power”, and with her dulcet voice and tuneful vibe, she has made a deliberate career statement that a new Afrobeats queen has emerged and eying the throne. Stylish with her vocals, excellently unpredictable with her delivery, and with her lyrics, she does wear her heart on her sleeve. The release of “Money and Power” on 21 April 2023 signifies that Memmuchi is manifesting everything good in music. Christened Chinemerem Nkwazema, Imo state indigene by heritage, Finnish by birth, Memmuchi is a hybrid of Tems, Ella Mai, Labianca, SZA, Latto, and Mariah the Scientist. With a distinct iconic voice texture reminiscent of Toni Braxton, Onyeka Onwenu- the Elegant Stallion, and Miriam Makeba – the legendary Mama Africa, the Memmuchi sound is unique; an urban vibe with an African undertone. She epitomizes pop culture. She’s in a league of her own. As one of Afrobeats’ emerging female stars signed to Synergy Soundz, she teamed up with multi-award-winning superstar Goya Menor on the song “Pokoe”, released on 14 April 2023. Judging by the real buzz around this head-banging bumping song and her ability to pull such a heavyweight for collaboration, it is not out of place to say Memmuchi is building an excellent pathway for a successful music career. She’s creating the right momentum toward attaining an A-list status. The release of the Damelo Wayne- produced “Money and Power” as her follow-up single is right on the money. The emotion about this song is reaching a crescendo and is now at a fever pitch. According to Memmuchi, “Money and Power” is a song to celebrate everyone winning in their little way at their various fields despite the odds. The song pays homage to everyone with a unique ability. Recording this single was fulfilling, enjoyable, and indicative of my music pathways. I know the audience will love it.”
