A group, Concerned Abia Youths (CAY), has raised the alarm and called for probe of Prince Christopher Enweremadu, the Abia State Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, alongside the cashiers and permanent secretaries in three local government areas of Abia State over alleged diversion of N1.160 billion funds meant for the development of infrastructures in the LGAs. The group, in a statement signed by its president, Comrade Martins Ochioha, and made available to newsmen in Umuahia on Friday, said that the affected local governments are Umuahia North and South, and Isuikwuato The group alleged that a total of N480 million and N680 million were “moved from the Joint Account Allocation Committee (JAAC) to Joint Projects Accounts (JPAs) in January and February respectively. It said the monies were thereafter moved from the Joints Projects Accounts between the local governments and the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs without proper accounts and due management procedures. CAY said that the missing unaccounted monies must be accounted for by those fingered in the alleged diversion. The group further called on the state government and the anti-graft agencies to investigate the whereabouts of the missing funds. According to the statement: “We draw your attention to the unprecedented diversion of N1.160 billion Abia State funds meant for the developments of three local government areas of the state. “This information is coming on the heels of complaints by some transition committee chairmen and councillors for lack of funds to execute projects as expected.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “We therefore urge the state government, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) to conduct an unbiased investigation into the allegations of embezzlement and misappropriation of the funds by the Abia State government officials. POLL “The Commissioner for Chieftaincy Affairs, the cashiers, and the permanent secretaries of these local governments have been tipped to be in connivance and should be held accountable or made to face the law,” the group noted.
