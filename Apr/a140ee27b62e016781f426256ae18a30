He admonished Plateau citizens not to allow this Easter to pass on as a mere ritual but Instead, they should let it be a period of true reflection on the virtues of sacrificial love and the renewal of life and hope. “‘ As we look forward to a New Plateau, may the God of Heaven saturate us with the burden of sacrifice and love, which is demonstrated by us striving to be our brother’s keeper. This would go a long way in helping us forget our differences and unite as a people for the great task ahead of rebuilding our dear and blessed State.” He prayed that Plateau indeed should witness the glory of resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.
