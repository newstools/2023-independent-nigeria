American singer Robert Sylvester Kelly has been moved from a Chicago correctional centre to a medium-security prison in North Carolina last week. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons spokesperson Benjamin O’Cone, he said the R’n’B singer was transferred from the Metropolitan Correctional Center Chicago to the federal correctional institution in Butner, North Carolina, on April 19. . However, the bureau said Monday via email, according to AP News reports, did not disclose the reasons for the singer’s transfers due to privacy, safety and security reasons. In February, a federal judge in Chicago sentenced the 56-year-old Grammy Award-winning R&B singer to 20 years in prison for child pornography and enticement of minors for sex. He will serve all but one of those simultaneously with a separate 30-year sentence on racketeering and sex trafficking convictions in New York. Kelly, who has vehemently denied the allegations, rose from poverty in Chicago to become one of the world’s biggest R&B stars. Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” he sold millions of albums even after allegations about his abuse of girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s.
