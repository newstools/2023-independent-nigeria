LAGOS  – Nigeria’s unemployment rate which stood at 37.7 per cent in 2022 is expected to climb further to 40.6 per cent in 2023, according to a recently released report by global professional service firm, KPMG titled: Global Economic Outlook. The report noted that unemployment in Nigeria is expected to increase on the back of limited investment by the private sector, low industrialization, as well as slower than required economic growth. The Nigerian section of the report, which was titled: “Challenging macroeconomic fundamentals in a transition period” was prepared by former Statistician-General of the NBS, now Chief Economist, KPMG in Nigeria, Dr. Oyeyemi Kale and Oluwole Adelokun, Associate Director, Strategy and Economics, KPMG in Nigeria. Nigeria’s real GDP grew by 3.52 per cent year over year in Q4 2022 compared to 2.25 per cent printed in the previous quarter, with an annual growth rate of 3.1 per cent for the year against 3.4 per cent in 2021. Growth in 2022 was driven by the non-oil sector, as continuous recovery in household consumption boosted spending, particularly in the finance and insurance services, telecommunications, and transportation and storage services. While the non-oil sector grew by 4.84 per cent, the oil sector contracted by 19.22 per cent, largely attributed to worsening oil theft, pipeline vandalization, underinvestment, and other operational challenges inhibiting oil production. The report estimates that Nigeria’s GDP will continue to grow at a relatively slow pace of 3% in 2023 due to the slowdown in economic activity that typically characterizes periods of political transition in Nigeria. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ Nigeria’s unemployment has been trending upward over the years, reaching a record high of 33.3 per cent in Q4 2020 according to the last NBS labour report, with over 23.1 million Nigerians out of jobs. This statistic is expected to worsen in recent times considering the ripple effect from the covid-19 pandemic, economic downturn, high inflation, and massive layoffs in the tech space amongst others. POLL The report reads, “Unemployment is expected to continue to be a major challenge in 2023 due to the limited investment by the private sector, low industrialization and slower than required economic growth and consequently the inability of the economy to absorb the 4-5 million new entrants into the Nigerian job market every year.” “Although lagged, the National Bureau of Statistics recorded an increase in the national unemployment rate from 23.1 per cent in 2018 to 33.3 per cent in 2020. We estimate that this rate has increased to 37.7 per cent in 2022 and will rise further to 40.6 per cent in 2023.” The report also highlighted the impact of the high inflation environment on the economy, with projections of at least 20 per cent in 2023. “Headline annual inflation main of the high inflation environment on the economy, with projections of at least 20 per cent in 2023.
