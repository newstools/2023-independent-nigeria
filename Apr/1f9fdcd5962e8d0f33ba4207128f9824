After defeating Bayern Munich 4-1 on aggregate in the quarterfinals, Manchester City will face the defending champions Real Madrid in the semi-finals of the Champions League. Also, it is going to be a Milan derby as Inter Milan plays AC Milan in the Semi. The fixture will be a repeat of last year’s extraordinary semi-final in which Real Madrid, champions of Europe on 14 occasions, prevailed 6-5 on aggregate despite City boasting a two-goal lead entering the final minute of the second leg. This year’s two legs will take place around City’s Premier League fixtures against Leeds, Everton and Chelsea as the odds continue to narrow on Pep Guardiola’s side winning the treble.
