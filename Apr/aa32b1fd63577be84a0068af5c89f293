European Union member countries’ envoys in Brussels will discuss this week a move by Poland and Hungary to ban grain and other food imports from Ukraine, a senior EU official said on Monday. The senior EU official, speaking under condition of anonymity, said low global prices and demand meant the grain was staying in the bloc rather than being sold on. The oversupply became a political problem for Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party in an election year. “We expect Poland and Hungary to offer some explanation and there will also be reaction by the European Commision,” said the official, adding that the matter was raised at the last summit of EU national leaders, including by Slovakia and Romania. “There is an issue and we expect the Commission to come up with a proposal on that… We’ll see what we can do in the coming weeks and months.” Ukraine’s agriculture minister said Kyiv wanted to re-open food and grain transit via Poland as a first step at talks in Warsaw on Monday.
