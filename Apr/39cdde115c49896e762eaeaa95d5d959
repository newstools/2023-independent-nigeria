Determined to deepen and strengthen the spiritual lives of Imo people, Governor Hope Uzodimma has ap­proved the sponsorship of a record 1,000 pilgrims to the holy lands of Israel and Jordan this year. State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Hon Declan Emelumba disclosed this in a state­ment issued in Owerri on Monday. Emelumba said the ap­proval has already been given to the Imo State Pil­grims’ Board to commence screening of would-be beneficiaries. According to him, forms have been sent to church­es and other segments of the society for them to dis­tribute to their interested members. The commissioner an­nounced that those nomi­nated have up to April 15, this year to submit their completed forms to the Christian Pilgrims’ Board. Speaking further on the exercise, Emelumba said Governor Uzodimma decided to sponsor this number of pilgrims this year because of his belief in both the physical and spiritual growth of Imo people. According to him, since his assumption of office in 2020, Uzodimma has made it a point of duty to per­sonally see to the welfare of the people.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He said unlike before when candidacy for the pilgrimage was restricted to well to do and connect­ed citizens, those going for this year are coming from all segments of the society, including the very poor. POLL He noted that the Gov­ernor started out by re­constituting the Christian Pilgrims’ Board with Rev Fr Dr Gilbert Alaribe as Chairman. The commissioner therefore asked all inter­ested candidates, irrespec­tive of social status, to ap­ply for selection.
