Nigerian comedian Ayo Makun, popularly known as AY, has responded to his colleague, Julius Agwu, over the accusation of hanging up a phone conversation with him. Recall that that following the lingering feud between Ayo Makun and Basketmouth over a certain N30,000 payment  Julius Agwu had claimed that AY hung up on him. Julius speaking about the issue in a recent interview, explained that there is more to the beef between his colleagues AY Makun and Bright Okpocha aka Basketmouth. He further went on to recall how AY cut the call on him when he noticed the comedian was planning a show on the same day he normally anchors his comedy show. He wrote in part, ”The truth remains the only ultimate power to downplay all the lies in a place where the INTERNET NEVER FORGETS. Dear senior colleague Julius Agwu, my question is, how is it even possible to lay claims to the fact that I took over your Easter Sunday date with the following verifiable facts…. Vowing to file a lawsuit against Agwu he wrote, ”Should this continue without any proof to your claims of me bewitching you, I will be filing a slanderous lawsuit against you for consistently trying to damage my reputation.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ ”Finally, Projecting Peace across boards doesn’t make me a weakling. Neither am I seeking any form of unnecessary friendship that is laced with negativity.’’
