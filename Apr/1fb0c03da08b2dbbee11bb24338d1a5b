Thierry Henry says Lionel Messi should return to Barcelona ‘for the love of football’ with PSG fans jeering the Argentine legend in recent games. Messi’s contract in Paris comes to an end at the climax of this season and he is yet to sign a new deal, with the club hoping he stays but on a significantly reduced salary. There is a strong possibility of a return to former club Barcelona, where he never wanted to leave but was forced to due to the club’s perilous financial state. Henry, who played with Messi at Barca, thinks it would be the right thing to do to return and go out a second time on his own terms, especially as he feels his treatment in Paris has been shoddy. A section of the PSG fans believe he has checked out, with his contract coming to an end, but Henry says the jeering is embarrassing. ‘It’s embarrassing to hear whistles from the Parc,’ Henry said on Amazon Prime. ‘You can’t whistle one of the best players on the team, who has 13 goals and 13 assists this season. ‘Personally, I would like to see him finish his career at Barcelona, in Europe.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ ‘After that, I don’t know what he will do. Because the way he left Barcelona after everything he did… POLL ‘I didn’t really like it. For the love of football, he should go back to Barcelona.’ Another former Arsenal and France hero, Emmanuel Petit, echoed Henry’s thoughts and went further, slamming PSG as a club incapable of improving players. ‘When I hear that, for me, it’s an insult to football,’ Petit told RMC. ‘It’s not a football club. It’s a pre-retirement club, even for 20-year-old players. ‘Nobody has improved while at PSG – is that Messi’s fault? He’s the magician with a wand, it’s up to the players around him to make an effort. ‘Only the PSG fans don’t get that you need a squad built around Messi, which they don’t have, and won’t ever have, because [the management] are terrible in the market.’
