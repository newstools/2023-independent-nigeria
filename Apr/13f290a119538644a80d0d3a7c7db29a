Plateau State Governor and Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum Simon Bako Lalong has felicitated with the Muslim ummah for the successful completion of the Ramadan fast and for being alive to witness another Eid el Fitr. Lalong in a message made available to newsmen in Jos through his Director of media Makut Macham, said the period provided them an opportunity to carry out spiritual rejuvenation and acts of charity that are in tandem with the message of Prophet Mohammed. He said the celebration of Eid el Fitr is not only significant to Muslims alone but provides and opportunity for people of other faiths to share in the joy and essence of the moment. According to Governor Lalong, the event should help Nigerians to reflect on love, tolerance, peace and good neighbourliness which are virtues that are enshrined in the teachings of the two major faiths in the country. Lalong urges Nigerians to celebrate with vigilance and report any suspicious activity to the security agencies who have been fully mobilised to respond to any threat to peace and security.
