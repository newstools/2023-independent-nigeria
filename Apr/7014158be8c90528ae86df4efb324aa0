In view of the ongoing war in the Republic of Sudan, the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC has called on the federal government to ensure the safety of the lives of Nigerian staying in the country. The NLC President, Comrade Joe Ajaero, in a press statement he signed on Saturday, expressed concern that Nigerians are becoming victims, and called for a peaceful resolution of the issues in dispute that led to the war. Ajaero stressed that it is the responsibility of the government of any nation to secure lives and properties while questioning why the Federal Government in Nigeria was yet to evacuate trapped Nigerians in Sudan. “At this point, we are not specially concerned about the history and immediate causes of the war but are worried because many Nigerians have become unwitting victims of the war and are stranded in that country and unable to get out.“They have cried out for help to escape the horrors which the war has continued to mete out to persons still trapped in Sudan. “The NLC is worried that since the war broke out towards the end of last week, reports reaching us on the number of human casualties are horrendous and frightening thus leaving every patriot anxious about the safety of our nationals in that country especially that of our students. “We believe that it remains the responsibility of any government to ensure the safety of their nationals which includes making sure that in the event of a war in foreign countries, their citizens are protected in whatever way possible. This is one of the central reasons for governance: the safety of lives and properties. “While we commiserate with the people and workers of Sudan and call for an immediate ceasefire to allow for a peaceful resolution of the issues in dispute that led to the war, we are at a loss as to why the federal government of Nigeria finds it difficult to guarantee the safety of the lives of our citizens in that country beyond the tokenism effort at protection through an advisory to all Nigerians in that country to either seek refuge in our embassy in Khartoum or stay indoors which they believe is safer,” he said.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
