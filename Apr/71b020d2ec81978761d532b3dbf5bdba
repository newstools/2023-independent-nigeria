ABUJA – Navy Director of Information, Commodore AO Ayo-Vaughan has denied the news circulating on social media alleging that the Nigerian Navy Reference Hospital is conducting Recruitment for 2023. Commodore Ayo-Vaughan stated this in a statement made available to the Daily Independent in Abuja. The statement reads in part, “The attention of the Nigerian Navy has been drawn to a message circulating on social media groups which states that Nigerian Navy Reference Hospital is conducting Recruitment for 2023 hence the message called interested and eligible candidates to submit their written application letter and other relevant credentials to Naval Headquarters, Abuja (Attention: The Director of Naval Medical Services). The message further advised applicants to include contact phone number and addresses of 3 referees one of whom must be from the applicant’s institution. “For the avoidance of doubt, there is no such recruitment by the Nigerian Navy Medical Services. It is an attempt to mislead and possibly defraud innocent and unsuspecting members of the public. Against this backdrop, members of the public are advised to be careful and cautions so as not be defrauded by criminals and fraudsters who are behind the false recruitment exercise. The Nigerian Navy’s Recruitment exercises are duly publicized and announced on both traditional and social media. Please disregard the false and fake message.”
