Norweigian goal machine Erling Haaland scored his 45th goal of the season and turned the hero of the night with one goal and one assist as English Champions, Manchester City thumped Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich by 3-0 in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League quarter-final fixture on Tuesday night at the Etihad stadium. Buoyed by the arrival of new Manager Thomas Tuchel who famously led Chelsea to beat Pep Guardiola’s men in the 2021 UCL final, the visitors were lively early in the first half, creating a handful of goalscoring chances but were repeatedly denied by Man City goalkeeper Ederson despite the best efforts of former City forward, Leroy Sane. But the outstanding Rodri put the home side ahead from an assist by Bernardo Silva, in the 27th minute. The goal, however, did not deter the Germans as they tried repeatedly but were unable to breach the City defence till the end of the first half. Expecting to pile more pressure on City in the second half, Bayern were shell-shocked when the hosts took the game to them and despite the apparent precautionary withdrawal of talismanic Kevin Debruyne due to a possible knock, Guardiola’s men scored two quick goals to seal the first leg and place one foot firmly in the semifinal. City Striker Haaland, who looked to have been quiet all game, provided a wonderful cross on a plate for Silva to head home after an error from a largely reliable but nervous Bayern defender Upamecano, in the 70th minute. Six minutes later, Haaland was on hand to poke home from close range after getting on the end of an inviting return header from John Stones inside the Bayern six-yard box. It was Haaland’s 11th goal in the UCL this season and his 45th goal of the season in all competitions. The Citizens will head for the Allianz Stadium in Bayern next Wednesday with the confidence that they have, on the strength of this night’s result, placed, at least a foot in the semifinal of the competition.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ FULL TIME: Manchester City 3 – 0 Bayern Munich (UCL Quarterfinal 1st Leg)
