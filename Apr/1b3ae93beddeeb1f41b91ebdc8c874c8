EJIKEME OMENAZU Rev. Dr. Andrews O. Okhirebhu, the Senior Pastor, Wordhedge International Assembly, Lagos has frowned at politicians who are unable to handle internal wrangling within their parties with wisdom Rev Okhirebhu, who spoke to Sunday INDEPENDENT on current crises in several political parties wondered why Nigerians politicians are different from their counterparts in other nations. He lamented that there was never a time there was no crises after any election, be it legislative of elections for executive positions at every level, both at the primaries and the elections proper. According to the cleric, the current crises in several political parties portray lack of political values and principles. Okhirebhu said: “It tells us there are no real political scientists in politics in Nigeria, rather we have ordinary businessmen in pursuit of wealth and riches pretending to be progressive politicians. “We lack men who are nationalistic and patriotic, ‘personal-trotics’. Listen to their campaigns, they cannot handle issues as they affect the economy and others.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “If I may ask: Political parties that cannot handle internal challenges, how can they govern a nation like Nigeria? POLL “The reason none of the parties can define and show you their political ideologies and models is because they are not after the welfare and governance of the citizenry, but personal acquisitions and positions through corruption.”
