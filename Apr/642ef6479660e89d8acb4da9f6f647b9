Bayelsa State governor, Senator Douye Diri, on Saturday, visit­ed the family of a slain Bayelsa youth, Douglas Joseph, to com­miserate with them over last Wednesday’s incident that led to his death. The young Douglas, a native of Epie from Yenizue-Epie com­munity in Yenagoa, the state capital, was reportedly stabbed by a commercial tricycle rider following disagreement over transport fare. The governor, who led top gov­ernment functionaries to the de­ceased’s family residence at the Kpansia area of the state capital, brought some succour to the fam­ily as he offered immediate em­ployment in the state civil service to wife of the late Douglas. A statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Daniel Al­abrah, on Saturday, quoted the governor as also announcing scholarships for the deceased’s three children, saying the state government would take over their education up to the univer­sity level. He equally directed the Com­missioner for Transport to imme­diately address the issue of hike in transport fares within Yena­goa and environs and report to him within one week. The governor commiserated with the immediate family and the entire Epie community, de­scribing the death of the prom­ising young man as sad and un­fortunate. Diri noted that the state was peaceful and the people very hos­pitable to visitors and investors and that the government would not condone the acts of those with evil agenda in the state.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ His words: “Following from this sad incident, the Secretary to the State Government is here­by directed to give the wife of late Douglas immediate employment.
