The Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN) on Thurs­day played host to the Manag­ing Director/CEO of Nigeria LNG Ship Management Limited, with his team of management officials who were guests to the Presi­dent -General of the Union, Comrade Adewale Adeyan­ju and some of his national and branch executives com­prising Comrades Francis Bunu, Abudu Eroje, Abu­bakar Bello, Ohize, Avoseh Sunday, Uche Igweonu, Edwin Sambo, Ayokun­le Ajayi, Comrade Oniha Erazua (DSG), Abdul-Kadir Ahmed, and John Kennedy Ikemefuna, at the National Secretariat, Lagos. The visit was to congrat­ulate Adeyanju, who was recently voted as the Depu­ty President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) at Abuja. The visit was geared to strengthen ties between NSML and the union in the areas of members, who are seafarers in the employ of the NSML in terms of their Collective Bargaining Agree­ment (CBA), which will com­mence soon. Adeyanju, who said he was impressed with the NSML management visit, spoke on issues that are important to both parties. However, both parties agreed to keep the good re­lationship they have since inception and promised each other transparency and coop­eration on all fronts towards striking success in the mari­time sector and securing the welfare of seafarers and the union in general.
