***Urges Nigerians, Residents To Utilize Portal Effectively ABUJA – The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) has reactivated the digitalised Central Motor Registry (CMR) unit. The first Phase (Stolen Vehicle Report Portal), a module in the digitalised Central Motor Registry Information System (CMRIS), was flagged off by the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Usman Alkali Baba, on December 7, 2022. The CMRIS is the mandatory registration of vehicle information by the Central Motor Registry and since inception about seven decades ago, it has been done manually and therefore faced with some challenges. Force Spokesperson, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi said in a statement to newsmen on Tuesday said, “The digitalized CMRIS will effectively serve the purpose of obtaining additional information from members of the public about stolen vehicles and populating the stolen vehicle database so as to ensure that vehicles to be registered by the CMR are not stolen and to aid investigation of stolen vehicles and vehicle-associated incidents. “Similarly, owners of motor vehicles operating on Nigeria roads and members of the public are hereby notified that the new procedure for requesting for the Nigeria Police Force Central Motor Registry services such as Motor Vehicle Information, Change of Ownership, Change of Engine/Chassis/Body, Change of Colour, International Motor Vehicle Certificate, International Drivers’ Permit, is to create a profile on the CMRIS portal and apply for the desired service via https://cmris.npf.gov.ng/.” He also stated that, “The Inspector-General of Police has directed the discontinuation of manual processing and issuance of all CMR documents/certificates and a migration to the digitalized NPF CMR platform.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “Consequently, all other CMR certificates hitherto issued by the Nigeria Police Force are therefore no longer valid/recognised forthwith.” POLL The IGP urged members of the public to cooperate with the police as the digitalised CMR platform will provide motor vehicle information for robust and proactive actions in crime prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution, and efforts toward enhancing national security.
