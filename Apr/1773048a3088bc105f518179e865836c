Bauchi-The Concerned members of the All Progressives Congress, Bauchi State chapter has called on all members of the APC in the state to be reunited, saying that the party will bounce back stronger despite the fact that it lost the governorship election. The Spokesman of the group, Hon Isa Matori who stated this while addressing Journalists during a press conference held at the NUJ press secretariat in Bauchi, said that even though the APC Gubernatorial candidate lost during the election, they are still hopeful that he will reclaim his mandate at the election tribunal. He debunked the allegation that a crisis has hit the party in the state following calls by some of it’s member to suspend it’s state chairman due to anti-party activities, stressing that the party only has some minor misunderstanding which is common in any party. Matori stated that all the congresses that held to produce Executive members of the party were single handedly sponsored by Mallam Adamu Adamu, the Minister of Education, adding that because the PDP government was afraid of losing out during the local government elections, it went ahead to select it’s local government council chairmen who did not contest any election. “Some of you know the truth of what happened during the last governorship election in the state, they said that our candidate, Air Marshal Sadique Baba Abubakar lost the election, but we did not lose the election.In the light of this, we, the APC concerned members in the state are calling on our members that this is not the time for the trading of blames, rather it is time to be more united than before so that we can pursue our case to a logical conclusion” “There is no need for us to fight because of anything, we are all equal members of the party.Mallam Adamu Adamu supported all the candidates that contested under the platform of the party with financial support, so because of that reason, we should reunite and be one family.We do not regard anybody as an outsider as long as you are a member of APC.What we need from everybody now, is total commitment to the party ” he said He said what is needed from every member of the party is patience, commitment, perseverance and loyalty so that the party can emerge successful when their case is mentioned at the election tribunal.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
