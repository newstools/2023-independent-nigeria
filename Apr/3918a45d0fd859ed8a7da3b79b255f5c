President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday paid glowing tributes to businessman and philanthropist, Dr. Mike Adenuga on his 70th birthday on Saturday, 29 April 2023. The President in a congratulatory message, signed by his spokesperson, Mr. Femi Adesina commended Dr. Adenuga’s dedication to nation-building and for always placing the interest of the nation first, as well as the welfare of the people, by ensuring that all his ventures and investments uphold human values of empathy, appreciation, trust and respect. He also said that the impact of Adenuga’s visionary leadership on Nigeria’s economy set the pace for investments in oil and gas, telecoms, real estate, banking, construction and hospitality, with a remarkable presence in supporting entertainment, sports and African culture, within and outside the country. President Buhari noted that the awards and recognitions bestowed on the billionaire, including three national honours, OON, CON and GCON, and many others of high note like “The Companion of the Star of Ghana’’ from Ghana and “Commander of the Legion of Honour’’ by French President, Emmanuel Macron are well deserved and lend credence to his enormous charity and goodwill. He therefore prayed for Otunba Adenuga’s good health, strength and wisdom for him to keep serving his country and humanity.
