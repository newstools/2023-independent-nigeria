Olayinka Akande, the bishop of the Diocese of Lagos-West, Meth­odist Church Nige­ria, Olayinka Akande, has urged the incoming adminis­tration to secure Nigeria. Akande said in his mes­sage to the 17th annual synod of the diocese that national security was essential to pro­tect lives and property, adding that national security would enable Nigerians to travel without fearing kidnappers. He said the administra­tion’s priority should be economic revitalisation and added that it must also involve the private sector in its affairs. “Theplanshouldcontainmea­surable targets for creating jobs, reducing poverty and decreasing thecostof living, improvingsecu­rity, and making space for a more collaborativeapproach. “Lagos State governor should kindly act on public outcry to curb the excesses of operatives of the Lagos State Transport Management Au­thority, Vehicle Inspection Of­fice, and the National Union of Road Transport Workers. “They are inflicting unnec­essary burden and hardship on the citizenry. And this has been done in the name of the government,’’ he noted and also implored Nigerians to participate fully in the oncom­ing National Population Cen­sus and be sure to be counted. While stressing that popula­tion figures and demographics must be near accurate for the country to distribute infra­structure equitably, the Meth­odist bishop also noted that a food crisis was looming and must be tackled with friendly and achievable policies.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ He listed one of such pol­icies as the Maputo Declara­tion on agriculture, which recommended that 10 percent of national budgets be allocat­ed to agriculture. POLL “Sadly, local government administration in Nigeria is comatose, and the peasant farmer who contributes to our food basket does not have access to financial and other support for upscale farming. “We have a federal repub­lic, but in reality, the federating units are majorly dependent on the almighty centre, which holds enormous powers.”
