Western Delta University (WDU), Oghara, Delta State, will tomorrow, April 29, hold its 15th Founders’ Day lec­ture. The lecture will form part of activities which have been lined up to mark WDU Founders’ Day with high-cal­ibre guests expected to attend the series of events. According to a statement by Mr. Etume Samuel, a co­ordinator of the celebration, those who have made spe­cial contributions to the fast growth and development of the University, as well as out­standing lecturers and former students will be celebrated and given awards at the event. “The day’s highlight is the lecture His Excellency, Dr. Fayemi Kayode, former Ekiti State Governor, will deliver: Title: “Sub-National Governance, the Ekiti State Example.” The statement also quoted the WDU Vice-Chancellor, Prof Augustine Ovuoronye Ikelegbe as saying, that “with that topic WDU wants to set an agenda for Nigeria as the next national and state ad­ministrations prepare for the May 29th inauguration day because true federalism is expected to gain more trac­tion nationally.” Prof Ikelegbe explained that “WDU takes the Town- Gown relationship most se­riously and that the nation should expect more of such academic interventions in fu­ture as Nigeria strives to actu­alize her manifest destiny of giving purposeful leadership to Africa and as WDU comes into her own as a leading uni­versity in this corner of the globe.” “The former Delta State Governor, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan will be the Chair­man of the occasion. Guests from all walks of life have indicated they will attend the stellar event,” the statement added.
