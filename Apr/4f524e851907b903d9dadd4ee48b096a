IBADAN – Visitor to the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso, and Governor of Oyo State, Engr. Seyi Makinde, has promised to ensure that more developmental attentions of government are channeled to the Institution to further demonstrate his belief in the ability of the Institution to deliver government’s aspiration for functional education for the people of the State. The governor who spoke at the last day of the week long 15th convocation of LAUTECH which held at the weekend admonished staff and students of the State owned Institution to shun every effort at thwarting the peaceful atmosphere pervading the University environment. According to him, we have realized that the risk we took in going for sole ownership of this place was however a worthy one and we are therefore determined to stake more of our resources, monetary and emotional, to further consolidate on the little gain that the people of Oyo State have sunk into the University. Speaking through the Deputy Governor of the State, Barrister Bayo Lawal, the Governor explained that contributions of staff and students of the Institution will never go unnoticed, “let me assure every stakeholder who has built with us that their labor of love will never be taken for granted”. Earlier in his own address, Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the University’s Governing Council, Professor Ayodeji Omole had told graduates and dignitaries that handlers of the citadel of learning were glad that the Institution had continued to win laurels which demonstrates that stakeholders are individually discharging their responsibilities as expected. In appreciating the host community, he added that government’s commitment to providing the nooks and cranny of the Pacesetter State with affordable and functional education through LAUTECH will never be taken for granted. Meanwhile, four distinguished Nigerians, including an alumnus of the University, Prince Tayo Adeyemi Adiatu; renowned Ambassador Hassan Tukur Ardo; the Managing Director of Bovas Nigeria Limited, Mrs. Victoria Adunola Samson; and Air Vice-Marshall Jacob Bolaji Adigun (Rtd), were conferred with honorary Doctorate degrees of the Institution.
