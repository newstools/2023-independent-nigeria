Nollywood actor, Gideon Okeke is giving his perspective on what it takes to hire an actor. Questioning the reason why filmmakers make him out to be difficult to work with, Okeke wondered why issues like stating boundaries, presenting a talent rider, insisting on a contract, negotiating back-end residuals, and insisting on well-cooked meals while filming make him the “bad guy”. “Why do these make me the bad guy or a divo? I value my craft. I see why they went with the other guy. Na Oyinbo train Me. No Vex. Hiring an actor is like trying to get in bed with a lady. The ‘lay’, depends on how she values herself. Not You. “Some girls na Maldives you need carry dem go. Some girls na Short time for Ilaje. Which girl you think say I be? I know we came to work. But why does work have to mean suffering and smiling? How many dues I need to pay before You agree say I be star boy?” He further stated that there is no foot-in-mouth intended as his post is just a figurative analogy for reasoning purposes. Responding to his query, another actor, Uti Nwachukwu opined that Nigerians hate due process because “they are mostly narcissistic”, are users and “modern day slave masters!” According to him, majority of actors are desperate and would accept close to nothing because they crave fame or to appear booked and busy “in a bid to fake oppress”. “On your own part, it’s the tone you use to convey your desires when u smile and keep calm and peacefully reject what’s beneath you. They won’t call you hard or difficult, they switch it to – ur shakara too much or you’re too expensive. I’d take being called expensive over being easy and cheap to get,” he added. ‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒
