PZ Wilmar, the company with edible oil and household prod­ucts and the variety of sea­soning cubes in Nigeria, has unveiled its latest promotion campaign, aimed at rewarding loyal consumers with airtime and cash prizes in the Devon Kings mega millionaire promo. A company in a statement said that the campaign would run for six weeks to May 26, 2023. The statement hinted that this would allow consumers to participate with multiple en­tries to win lots of airtime as well as amazing cash prizes. It emphasized that custom­ers could earn instant airtime once they use the unique PIN numbers, which are then sent to 8011, while weekly draws would be held every Friday for the duration of the campaign as an electronic raffle draw. “We are excited to launch the Devon Kings Mega Millionaire promo campaign as a way of appreciating our consumers for their continued support and loyalty through the tough times,” said Chioma Mbanugo, Head of Marketing, PZ Wilmar. “We recognize that times have been tough, and we want to do our part to make things a little easier for our consumers by rewarding their loyalty and un­ending support for Devon Kings Cooking Oil.”
