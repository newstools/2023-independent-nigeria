Organisers of the fast-growing gospel music show, XPression With CDO have kicked off the event train across selected Nigerian universities across Nigeria. This much was revealed by the organisers during the well-attended press conference held recently at the Four Points Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos, which had the presence of gospel music artistes like Mendo AY, Gaise Baba, Timi Phoenix, Fega Billionaire and Bouphy. Speaking at the press briefing, the founder and brain behind the show, John CDO Ikeotuonye, explained that the musical show is not just a musical event, but a unique opportunity for several renowned music stars, as well as, up-and-coming gospel music artistes to use their God-given talents to impart the gospel of Jesus Christ on the restive and impressionable youths in the society. “XPression With CDO, is not the usual music show. There’s something special about it. This project is more of a divine movement and the spirituality behind it is uncommon,” Ikeotuonye remarked. “This is a journey that began during the peak period of COVID-19. We set up a musical studio, we moved on to unusual places like nightclubs, lounges and barracks. This is a platform for urbane gospel music. XPression With CDO, is a platform where God wants to meet a certain kind of people. The music on this platform is hip, chic and urbane, even as the essence is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ,” he further explained. National Coordinator of the show, Rita Obi, went on to disclose that XPression With CDO, is expected to tour over 52 Nigerian University campuses, beginning with Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife, which was visited on March 31. “We’re taking XPression With CDO, which is to further propagate the gospel of Christ to Nigerian youths on the campuses. “The tour began on March 31, at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State. We are starting from the Southwest and onto other geopolitical zones in the country,” she explained.
