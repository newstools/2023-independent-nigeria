NICHOLAS UWERUNONYE There is no overt enthusiasm over the economic indicators of the country despite an 8.6% year-on-year growth in non-oil exports in the eleven months leading up to November 2022. Rather, analysts on Proshare, an economic intelligence platform suggest that the progress may not represent any significant improvement to the country’s export profile. According to data from the Central Bank of Nigeria, total exports in the same period rose by 37.5 per cent YoY to $58.62 billion, up from $42.62 billion in 11M 2021 showing that the growth numbers may be reflective of a fairly low base. More so, the contribution of non-oil exports to total exports declined in the period to 10.1 per cent from 12.8 per cent in the same period of 2021, this is despite efforts by the Federal Government to diversify exports. The National Development Plan (NDP) 2025 which aims to achieve N44trn in export revenue, the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN’s) RT 200 program, and the Nigerian Export Promotion Council’s (NEPC) Zero Oil Plan are various new programs meant to boost non-oil export (NOE) earnings. The Race To $200 billion (RT 200) was introduced by the CBN in 2021, to attract $200 billion in NOE earnings within three to five years.
