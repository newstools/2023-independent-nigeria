The National Drug Law En­forcement Agency (NDLEA) has declared a Port Harcourt, Rivers State based popular prophetess and founder of Christ Power Adoration Minis­tries, Faith Ugochi, and a celeb­rity couple, Igho Ubiribo and Danielle Simba Allen, wanted for allegedly recruiting teenage girls into drug trafficking while they serve as the arrowheads of an international syndicate operating from Los Angeles, USA. In a statement by Femi Babafemi, the agency’s spokes­man, the lid was blown off the cartel when NDLEA operatives at the NAHCO import shed of the Murtala Muhammed Inter­national Airport, Ikeja, Lagos, intercepted a consignment of 32.70 kilogrammes of Loud, a strong variant of cannabis concealed in cartons of used wears on Wednesday, Novem­ber 16, 2022. According to the statement, a freight agent, Ukoh Ifeanyi Oguguo, was immediately arrested while further investi­gations led to the arrest of four more suspects, Chikodi Favour; Obiyom Shalom Chiamaka; Nnochiri Chidinma Promise and Edward Omatseye (aka Montana). “The 15-year-old Favour was the first sales girl to be arrested at a fuel station in Ajah area of Lagos. She thereafter led the operatives to a duplex accom­modation around Ikate area of Lekki, which was later discov­ered to be a rented apartment by the criminal group purpose­ly for four young girls that the syndicate uses for marketing and distribution of illicit drugs. Another girl, Shalom, who is a fresh graduate of Agricultural Science from Rivers State Uni­versity of Science and Technol­ogy was picked from the house alongside Favour.
