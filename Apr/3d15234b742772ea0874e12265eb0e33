A report from Sergio Fernandez claims that Aymeric Laporte is unhappy at Manchester City, and he wants to return to Spain by joining Barcelona, his preferred destination. However, Premier League side Newcastle United are keen on securing the services of the 28-year-old Spanish international as well. The defender is currently without an agent, and he has been in discussions with Arturo Canales who could represent him. Canales is also the agent of Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez. Given the player wants to join Barcelona and he could employ the services of Canales, it is fair to assume that the Catalan giants have an edge in the transfer race. Barcelona need to add more depth to their squad in order to compete on all fronts next season. They have done well in La Liga this term, but their European campaign has been a bit of a disaster The Blaugrana will hope to do well in the Champions League next season, and they must look to improve their squad. Laporte would be an inexpensive signing for him. Given his stature at Manchester City, he is unlikely to cost a premium. Barcelona have two quality central defenders in Jules Kounde and Ronald Araujo. But Xavi has used them as right-back from time to time. Also, Eric Garcia has been linked with a return to the Premier League in the last few days. Laporte would be a quality signing for Barcelona. He is at the peak of his powers and could make an immediate impact. The 28-year-old has played in Spain with Athletic Club in the past and he will be able to settle in quickly. Meanwhile, Newcastle need to add more quality to the side as well. They are well-placed to secure Champions League qualification and need a better squad to cope with European football. They have more resources than Barcelona. But the playerâ€™s preference to join Barcelona could play a big part in the transfer. Newcastle must convince Laporte of their project first.
