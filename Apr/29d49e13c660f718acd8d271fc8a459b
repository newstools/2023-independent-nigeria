ABUJA – The latest social media campaign by Peak Milk manufacturer Friesland Campina WAMCO Nigeria PLC, which utilized Jesus Christ’s crucifixion as a metaphor to market their product on Good Friday, has been met with total dismay by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN). The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) General Secretary, Barr. Joseph Daramola issued a statement that was available to news reporters in Abuja that stated, “We find this advertisement to be insensitive, offensive, and totally unacceptable.” The statement reads: “Good Friday is a solemn day for Christians all over the world, a day we commemorate the death of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who was crucified on the cross for our sins. It is not a day to be used for crass commercial purposes. “Friesland Campina WAMCO Nigeria PLC’s action is not only disrespectful to the Christian faith but also an affront to the millions of Christians in Nigeria and beyond. We are deeply disappointed that a company of such repute would stoop so low to exploit the religious sentiments of its customers for profit. “We are considering sanctions against FrieslandCampina WAMCO Nigeria PLC, including a boycott of their products by our members and all well-meaning Nigerians who share our concerns. We call on the company to issue an unreserved apology to the Christian community and withdraw the offensive advert immediately. “We recall a similar incident in the past when Sterling Bank Plc. used a crucifixion imagery to promote their product. We condemned it then, and we condemn it now. We, therefore, urge all companies and organizations to be mindful of the religious and cultural sensitivities of their customers when promoting their products. We will not tolerate any attempt to trivialize or disrespect our faith. Be warned!”, the stater further stated.
