The police in Lagos have arrested Nigerian artist Habeeb Okikiola known as Portable at the expira­tion of an ultimatum to submit himself. Ogun State Police Spokes­person, Abimbola Oyeyemi confirmed that Portable was arrested and held at the state headquarters of the police in Eleweran, Abeokuta. Oyeyemi disclosed that Por­table was arrested after refusing five invitations. Portable resisted arrest on Wednesday when police officers were at his bar to arrest him. The police said Portable ex­hibited irrational behaviour and hurled insults at officers carrying out their legal duty, an action that is punishable by the laws of Nigeria. Several videos of Portable narrating his encounter with police officers went viral on so­cial media platforms. “The NPF will take all neces­sary steps to investigate his ac­tions and ensure that he is prose­cuted for any criminal activity he may have committed depending on the severity of the offense,” police spokesman Muyiwa Ade­jobi said in a statement.‒‒:‒‒/‒‒:‒‒ “The Police will not condone any unruly act, assault, or attack on its officers who are on lawful duty. We need to respect our law enforcement agents who per­petually take the risk of main­taining law and order and fight crimes and criminality in our society.”
