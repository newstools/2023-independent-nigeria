POLL Professor Soyinka is a globally renown playwright, novelist, poet, and essayist in the English language, who was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Literature, for “a wide cultural perspective and with poetic overtones fashioning the drama of existence”, the first sub-Saharan African to be honoured in that category. The BookTrek is a front in the campaign for Literacy, geared towards boosting citizens’ EDUCATION, ENLIGHTENMENT and EMPOWERMENT, to achieve CORA’s fundamental mission of building HUMAN CAPITAL capacity of the nation and the continent.
