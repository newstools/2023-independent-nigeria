The latest killings and destruc­tion of properties, including houses, farmlands and domestic animals, is coming barely a week after the state governor, Agbu Ke­fas, met with traditional rulers and heads of security agencies on the need to foster peace. “Taraba State, like many parts of our great nation, has been grappling with the scourge of insecurity. The rising cases of banditry, kidnapping, communal clashes, and farmer-herder con­flicts have caused immense pain and sufferings to our people,” he said during the meeting. “The loss of innocent lives, displacement of communities and destruction of properties have cast a dark cloud over our once peaceful state. Our collec­tive responsibility is to confront these challenges head-on and restore peace and security to our state. “In the face of such adversi­ties, unity and collaboration be­comes paramount. We must set aside our differences to embrace dialogue and work together to find a lasting solution. “Your Royal Highnesses, I implore you to harness your influence, bring your commu­nities together, and foster an at­mosphere of understanding and cooperation; by fostering peace at the grassroots, or at the grass­roots level, you can pave the way for a harmonious and prosperous state as I said earlier, as the cus­todians of our traditions and cul­ture, you possess a unique power to shape the hearts and minds of our people.”
