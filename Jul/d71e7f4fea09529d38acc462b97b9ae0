IBADAN  – No fewer than three students of JSAY pre-varsity students have received the June and November 2022 British Council recognition and Outstanding Cambridge Learners awards out of 149 Ni­gerian students awarded by the council. One out of the three JSAY pre-varsity students, Miss Aris­totess Ufuophu-Biri, came top in Nigeria in June 2022 Cambridge International A level examina­tion in Physics, Biology and Chemistry. The remaining two JSAY pre-varsity students, recipients of the British Council awards, came top in November 2022 Cam­bridge International A Level in Physics and Information Tech­nology. Speaking with newsmen on Saturday in Ibadan on the award, the Director of JSAY pre-var­sity, Mrs. Olajumoke Akere, expressed her delight over the awards. Akere said that this was not the first or second time the school would be receiving British Coun­cil awards and that it had been consistent. It would be recalled that the Cambridge Assessment Inter­national Education, in partner­ship with the British Council, celebrated the top performing students from 45 schools across Nigeria on Thursday in Lagos.
