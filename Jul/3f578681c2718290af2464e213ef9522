A study conducted on the Worldwide Cloud Workload Security Market Shares by IDC (International Data Corporation), a premier global market intelligence firm, has revealed that Trend Micro Incorporated, a global cybersecurity leader, for the fifth time, has continued to retain its lead position as the number one vendor of choice on cloud security matters. The data, which appears in the IDC Worldwide Cloud Workload Security Market Shares, 2022: A Shifting Landscape (doc #US50197823, May 2023), also noted that Trend Micro holds a share more than twice that of its nearest competitor. The IDC report which highlighted a surging demand for cloud workload security indicated thus: “The overall size of the market increased by nearly 27 per cent annually to reach $2.6bn worldwide. Trend Micro’s cloud-specific revenue is predicted as greater than that of the second and third largest vendors combined.” Gareth Redelinghuys, Country Managing Director African Cluster at Trend, remarked that Trend was early to spot the transformational potential in cloud and the need to secure this growing attack surface. Also, that with a 16 per cent market share today, there is no vendor out there that comes close to the depth of their threat intelligence and geographic diversity of their customer base. Redelinghuys noted further that their focus now is to give their customers what they are increasingly demanding for, which is a broad set of powerful cloud security capabilities, delivered seamlessly to protect data, no matter where it is.
