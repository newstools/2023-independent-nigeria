Lazio quickly rekindled their interest in Piotr Zielinski as Sergej Milinkovic-Savic is highly likely to transfer to Saudi Arabia. Napoli’s president Aurelio De Laurentiis had strong words toward players entering the final year of their contracts. Per Alfredo Pedullà, the Partenopei asked the Pole to reduce his €3.5M salary to re-up. He refused and is de facto for sale. The Biancocelesti inquired a week ago. The request is €25M plus €5M add-ons. Lazio have an inferior valuation for Zielinski, but they could come close thanks to the Milinkovic-Savic windfall. The 29-year-old would reunite with Maurizio Sarri.
