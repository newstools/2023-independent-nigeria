IBADAN – The Speaker, Oyo State House of Assembly, Adebo Ogundoyin, has assured that the 10th Oyo State House of Assembly will be special in all ramifications.

Ogundoyin, whileanswering questions from the anchor, May­or Isaac Brown, on his vision for the 10th Oyo State House of Assembly, said though the 9th Oyo Assembly did excellently well, this new Assembly in the state will strive to make more impacts in all areas. “Our collective vision is to make the 10th Oyo State House of Assembly a special one. The newly inaugurated 10th Oyo State House is set to make meaningful impacts in all aspects. We have a combi­nation of returning and new lawmakers who are vibrant and intelligent.” Ogundoyin added that as a young parliamentarian just like others, he has learnt the nitty-gritty of lawmaking at least with five years’ experi­ence and he is set to bring it to bear in the 10th Oyo State House of Assembly. “I want to say that the 10th Oyo State House of Assembly may not be about the number of bills passed. But it is going to be about bills that will accel­erate all round development in Oyo State. The bills may be few this time around but we will ensure that they are those that will have direct positive bearings on the lives of the people. Our people must enjoy Omituntun 2.0 more than Om­ituntun 1.0.”, the Speaker said.
