LAGOS  – Nigeria’s Simi Nwogugu, the Chief Executive Officer of JA Af­rica has been named the winner of the Africa Education Medal 2023. Founded last year by T4 Ed­ucation and HP in collaboration with Microsoft, the Africa Ed­ucation Medal is Africa’s most prestigious education accolade. The Africa Education Medal was founded to recognise the tire­less work of those changemakers who are transforming African education. The Nobel Peace Prize-nomi­nated JA Worldwide, one of the world’s largest youth-serving NGOs that prepares young peo­ple for the future of work. Nwogugu was first introduced to JA while working at Goldman Sachs in New York City. Impressed by the organisa­tion, she quit her lucrative job at age 24 to bring JA to Nigeria, where it now reaches more than 100,000 young people annually, before going on to head up JA’s operations across the continent. Through the delivery of hands-on, blended learning in fi­nancial literacy, work readiness, and entrepreneurship, her organ­isation empowers young people to grow their entrepreneurial ideas, hone their work readiness skills, manage their earnings and secure better lives for themselves, their families, and their commu­nities. For 25 years, Nwogugu has been leading JA’s efforts in vari­ous capacities as it embarked on a mission to help young people to generate and effectively man­age wealth, create jobs for their communities, as well as apply entrepreneurial thinking to the workplace and skills that will se­cure their financial future.
