Inter, who signed Lukaku on loan from Chelsea last season, submitted a bid worth €30m (£25.6m/$33m) to sign the Belgian striker permanently which the Premier League side reportedly rejected. And now Lukaku is considering making a move to Saudi Arabia with Al-Hilal interested in signing him, according to Jacob Steinberg. Lukaku still has three years left in his existing contract with the Blues but it is unlikely that he will continue at Stamford. He is due to re-unite with his Chelsea teammate for pre-season training but new Blues boss Mauricio Pochettino recently hinted that Lukaku could be on his way out of the club. Lukaku already rejected a lucrative offer from Al-Hilal last month as he was determined to play for Inter in the upcoming season. If Inter does not place a second bid, Lukaku could consider leaving Europe for Saudi Arabia in the summer although he also has an offer from Juventus.
