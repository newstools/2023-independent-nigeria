The Office of the Accoun­tant-General of the Federation (OAGF) has attributed the delay in the payment of June salary to technological difficulties. Mr. Bawa Mokwa, OAGF’s Director of Press, on Wednes­day stated that the office is work­ing around the clock to remedy the issue. The delay, Mokwa said, was caused by technical issues with the Government Integrated Fi­nancial Management System (GIFMIS), one of the salary platforms. “As we speak, the directors and the consultant in charge of the platforms are in a crucial meeting, working round the clock to resolve the problem. “Anytime from now, the sal­aries will start to drop,” he said. Meanwhile, some civil servants in Abuja have been lamenting delay in the payment of June salaries. According to Mrs. Uloma Of­for, the salary is overdue. “I depend on this monthly salary to survive. I pay my debts and buy food items, but with the delay all these are not possible. I plead with the Federal Govern­ment to pay up so I can restock my home, my children are cry­ing at home,” she said. POLL Another civil servant, Mr. Jones Tolu, said the delay in the payment of salary, coupled with the removal of petrol sub­sidy, had made life difficult for the masses. “My friends in some para­statal and ministries received their June salaries, but not all of them. My children cannot go to school because I have outstand­ing payment to make and their examination comes up soon. “The government is not even saying anything. They should take urgent steps to address the situation so that civil servants can meet their financial needs,” he said. A trader in Wuse Market, Ibrahim Umar, said that he ex­perienced low patronage over the Sallah celebration and is still experiencing it due to the delay. “The market has been expe­riencing low patronage in re­cent times, and this is connected to the delay in payment of June salary to civil servants.”
