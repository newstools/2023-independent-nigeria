LAGOS  – The Federal Government has ordered the suspension of a newly introduced 10% tax on single-use plastics and excise duty on some locally manufactured products to reduce business costs Nigeria is one of the biggest plastic polluters in Africa, contributing some 2.5 million tonnes of plastic waste annually, some of which ends up in the sea, official data shows. Dele Alake, a spokesperson for President Bola Tinubu, said the President signed the new Executive Orders suspending a green tax on single-use plastics, including plastic containers and bottles, that was introduced in March. The order according to Alake, also suspended implementation of a 5% telecoms tax first mooted by the previous government and stopped an increase in car import duty and excise duty on selected goods manufactured locally. “As a listening leader, the president issued these orders to ameliorate the negative impacts of the tax adjustments on businesses and chokehold on households across affected sectors,” Alake told reporters. It would be recalled that the commencement date of the Financial Act 2023 from May 28, 2023 to September 1, 2023 to reflect the 90 days minimum advance notice for tax changes in line with provisions of the 2017 National Policy via The Finance Act (Effective Date Variation) Order, 2023; the deferment of the commencement of implementation of The Customs, Excise Tarif 2023 to August 1 2023 from March 27 2023 also to reflect the advance notice for tax changes as provided by the 2017 National Policy via the Customs, Excise Tariff (Variation) Amendment Order, 2023; the suspension of the 5% Excise Tax on telecommunication services and the Excise Duties escalation on locally manufactured products; and the suspension of the nascent Green Tax by way of Excise Tax on Single Use Plastics (SUPs) including plastic containers and bottles, and the suspension of Import Tax Adjustment levy on certain vehicles. Tinubu, who took office in May, has embarked on Nigeria’s boldest reform agenda in decades, including the removal of a popular petrol subsidy and restrictions on foreign exchange trading, as he seeks to boost sluggish growth. There would be no further tax rises without wider consultations, Alake said, adding that Tinubu would pursue business-friendly policies.
