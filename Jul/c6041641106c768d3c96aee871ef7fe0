LAGOS  – The United Action Front of Civil Society, the um­brella platform for the organised Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) on issues of governance and democracy, has considered the combative reaction of the Tinubu-led presidency over the recently released report of European Union- Election Observation Mission (EU-EOM) as panicky self-indictment. The group noted that the fren­zy and undiplomatic attack and sponsored protest against the EU for making known its im­partial observations of the flaws and criminality that character­ised the February 25 presidential election in Nigeria was a clear demonstration of bad faith. A press statement signed by Olawale Okunniyi, Head, National Coordinating Centre, United Action Front of Civil Society, noted that it was obvi­ous that the Tinubu-led regime is troubled by the burden of the flawed mandate it currently pre­sides over. The leadership of the group condemned the combative pos­ture of the new administration, whose handlers are regrettably unmindful of the responsibility and decency require of the pres­idency of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “It reeks of bare-faced hy­pocrisy for the Tinubu admin­istration to accuse the EU of attempting to ridicule the Ni­gerian electoral system and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), when in fact the election observers report of the EU only partly captures the widespread flaws majorly orchestrated by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) during the February 25 presi­dential elections as well as the governorship polls held March 18, 2023. “The United Action Front of Civil Society however com­mends the EU-EOM for the courage demonstrated in stating the facts though it is evident that the atrocities and grand robbery that characterised the 2023 gen­eral elections in some parts of the country, were either not cap­tured or under-reported. “We maintain that the final EU Election Observers report on 2023 general elections presented by Barry Andrews in Abuja calls for sober reflections as Nigeria can only ill afford to thread the ugly path of under-performance by INEC coupled with the inter­ference of the incumbents in future elections. “While we appreciate the des­peration of President Tinubu’s handers for the pitiable defence of an obviously rigged process in which their principal has be­come the beneficiary in the in­terim, we however marvel at the insincerity and lack of decency in pretending that the presiden­cy presided over by Tinubu can genuinely affirm the credibility of 2023 polls on behalf of Nige­ria and Nigerians.”
