LAGOS  – The Association of Maritime Journalists of Nigeria (AMJON) has felicitated with Adewale Ad­eniyi, the newly appointed Comp­troller General of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS). The association in a congratu­latory letter to the Customs boss said that the Federal Govern­ment of Nigeria’s appointment of Deputy Comptroller General Olawale Adeniyi as the Acting Controller-General of Nigeria Customs Service was a clear case of selection of a round peg in a round hole. AMJON in the letter signed by Paul Ogbuokiri and Segun Oladipupo, President and Secre­tary, respectively, described Ad­eniyi as a thoroughbred profes­sional that has the capacity and know-how to steer the ship of the service under the new Customs and Excise Management Act (CEMA) and E-Customs project successfully to the anchor. The letter read in part: “We in AMJON have no iota of doubt in our minds about your ability to succeed in this onerous lead­ership task trusted on you by the President and Command­er-in-Chief of the Nigeria Armed Forces, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and we want to assure you of our cooperation and total support to you and hope that you will reciprocate same by carrying us along in all your programmes and policies.” Recall that Adeniyi’s appoint­ment was announced by Presi­dent Bola Tinubu on June 19, 2023 and was recently decorated by the Vice President, Kashim Shettima. AMJON, which is noted to have maintained a robust relationship with the Nigeria Customs Service over the years believes that the emergence of Adeniyi who was the longest serving Public Relations Officer of the Service, would change the narrative in customs. The association reiterated its commitment to collaborate with the service in promoting customs processes and procedures in line with trade facilitation and inter­national trade.
