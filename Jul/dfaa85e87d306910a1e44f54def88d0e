FC Barcelona have had relatively smooth sailings thus far in the summer transfer window. They had already shortlisted their ideal candidates to bring in the summer and have more or less managed to finalize the operations and close them down for most of the selected players. Except for the inability to give a certain Argentine his long-awaited return to the club, Barcelona managed to officially announce the signing of Ilkay Gundogan from English Premier League side Manchester City. The Catalan club now works towards finalizing the operations for Turkish talent Arda Guler of Fenerbahce, and Brazilian prodigy Vitor Roque. However, the next official step will be to publicly confirm and announce the signing of the player Barcelona agreed terms with before any one of their summer arrivals thus far. According to an image provided by Jijantes FC and highlighted by SPORT, soon-to-be Barcelona defender Inigo Martinez was present today at the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper to have his pictures taken to officially confirm his signing soo Through the image provided, it can be deduced that it will not be long from now that Barcaâ€™s official pages confirm his signing while the presented image already makes it clear that the Catalans have indeed secured the transfer of the former Athletic Bilbao defender as a free agent, given the expiration of his previous contract at the end of June. It is now essentially only a matter of time before Barcelona finally publish a post or more confirming the signing of the 32-year-old central defender, who is bound to give Barcelona extra quality and reliable depth for the upcoming 2023/2024 season.
