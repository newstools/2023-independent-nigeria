P/HARCOURT – The management of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, has faulted a fake contract scam by some faceless individuals aimed at tar­nishing the image of the Commission and that of the Managing Director of the Commission. The fake letter purportedly notified an Italian company of an award of a contract for €56,250,000. NDDC said the fake letter neither states the purpose of the contract nor the consideration for the award. Dr. Ibitoye Abosede, Director of Corporate Affairs said in a statement that: “we hereby state unequivocally that the document is fake. The pur­ported contract is also a scam. It does not exist either in the records of the Commission nor is any of our officials aware of it”. Abosede said “we have taken a close look at the document and wish to point out the following: Contract awards in NDDC follow due process stipulated by the Procure­ment Act. At the end of that process, the successful bidder is issued an award letter signed by the Director of Procurement. “That award letter is on a security paper, with a serial number and a QR code. Contract award letters do not come from the desk of the managing director. The fake letter dated June 1, 2023, was purportedly signed by the managing director and the minister of Niger Delta Affairs. The managing director signed no such letter. In any case, the signature on the fake docu­ment is not that of our managing di­rector. Also, Nigeria had no Minister of Niger Delta Affairs by June 1, 2023 as the Federal Executive Council was dissolved before the hand-over of pow­er on May 29, 2023”. He said that the fake letter failed all the Commission’s branding stan­dards. POLL “Our take is that the letter is a product of a cheap scam. It has no relationship whatsoever with the Commission. “We hereby advise all stakeholders and interested parties to cross check any purported letter of contract award with the Procurement Department of the Commission.”
