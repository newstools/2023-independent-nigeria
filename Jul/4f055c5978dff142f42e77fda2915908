WARRI – Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Wednesday set aside an order previously granted to seal the property and assets belonging to Member Representing Isoko North/South Federal Constituency, Honourable Jonathan Ukodhiko. The court had on May 19, 2023, through suit No: FHC/PH/CS/88/2023, ordered the sealing of his Company’s office in Port Harcourt and his Isoko country home at Erawah-Owhe, Isoko North Local Government Area of Delta State, over a business transaction involving Joeny Holdings Limited, an oil and gas conglomerate he once had interest in. But delivering judgment on the matter, Justice Dalyop Pam upheld the preliminary objection of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Respondents, adding that the Federal High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. The court also held that the EFCC had no business in debt recovery, which was the basis of the Applicants’ petition and suit and therefore set aside the Order of the Honourable Court made on the 19th of May, 2023. Counsel to Ukodhiko, Emeka Etiaba SAN had told the court that his client resigned from the Company since 2021 and therefore had no correlation with the business transaction. Reacting to the ruling, Ukodhiko commended the court for doing justice on the matter, adding that the malicious sealing of his property was politically motivated. He said that over the years, he had kept clean records as a successful businessman and would not be involved in any act capable of undermining the privileged position he occupies in the National Assembly. He thanked God, his supporters and the people of Isoko nation for their support and understanding, assuring that he would remain focused in delivering on the people’s mandate.
