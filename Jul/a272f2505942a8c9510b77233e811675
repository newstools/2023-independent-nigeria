Morice Chukwu has parted ways with Rivers United fol­lowing the expiration of his contract. Chukwu joined the Pride of Rivers from Akwa United in 2021. The mercurial midfielder has been linked with a move abroad as he seeks a new chal­lenge. The player announced his exit from the club through so­cial media. “In the last couple of weeks, I have been engaged in a very emotional conversation with Management and the Board of Directors concerning my fu­ture,” an emotion-laden Chuk­wu wrote on his Twitter handle. “After several consultations, it was resolved that my desire to continue my career path elsewhere after two and a half years of dedicated service to Rivers United be respected by all involved. “I thank Dr. Okechukwu Kpalukwu, the Management, Technical Team, the players, and the fans for their support throughout my years with the team. I will forever cherish my time with the family. Long Live The Pride of Rivers!!!.” Chukwu is leaving Rivers United on a high after scoring the winning goal in the club’s 3-2 win against Bendel Insurance last weekend.
