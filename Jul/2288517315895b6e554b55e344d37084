Comrade Akeem Olayiwola, a logistics expert, was the governorship candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) in Lagos State in the 2023 elections. He spoke to EJIKEME OMENAZU on the party’s loss in the elections, the dire need to change the way governance is run in Lagos and the party’s plan to remain relevant to effect change in the country. Excerpt: Your party did not win in Lagos and parts of the country during the last elections. How would you explain what happened and why it did not perform as expected? It is important to note that every election is unique and there are often multiple factors that contribute to the outcome. Some common reasons include high level of money politics witnessed during the last election. The ruling class has deployed poverty as a weapon. With 133 million multi-dimensionally poor Nigerians, it becomes easier to buy their votes. Secondly, there was a high level of election malpractices across the country, which affected the performance of our party. Since after the elections, what recovery mechanism has the party’s leadership in the state put in place to ensure that it remains afloat without losing its supporters and members? After losing the past election, AAC party leaders, including Comrade Omoyele Sowore, have taken and are currently taking several steps to help the party recover and maintain support of its members to understand their concerns and perspectives. These involve holding town hall meetings, conducting surveys, and hosting focus groups, listening to feedback from party members and supporters. By so doing, the party leaders have strived to gain valuable insights into how to improve the party’s appeal and messaging. Also, the party leaders have maintained a visible and active presence in the media and public discourse. These involve giving speeches, writing opinion pieces, and participating in interviews. By staying engaged with the public, the party leaders have helped to keep the party’s message and platform in the public eye. Additionally, the party leaders are working to build and maintain strong relationships with other political leaders and organisations. By collaborating with other groups and individuals who share the party’s values and goals, the party can build a broader coalition of support and work towards achieving its objectives over the long term. What have you been doing to keep your dream of ruling Lagos alive? To keep the dream of ruling a Lagos State alive, our party has taken several steps. One of such steps is building a strong grassroots base. The ACC has built a strong base of supporters at the grassroots level by reaching out to people, understanding their needs and addressing their concerns. This required a sustained effort to build a network of volunteers, party workers, and leaders who can mobilise voters and support the party’s agenda. The party has a clear vision and platform that articulates its goals and priorities for the state and the nation at large. This is because we have a thorough understanding of the state’s political, economic, and social landscape, as well as the aspirations of its people. The party’s platform is grounded in a set of principles and values that resonate with voters and inspire them to support the party. The leadership of the party at the state level has displayed courage and strong belief in the party’s ideology. The state leadership has succeeded in putting in place strong party structure across the 245 wards, 37 Local Council Development Authorities (LCDAs) and 20 Local Governments in Lagos State. Our ward, local government, senatorial districts and state meetings are held regularly and we are attracting new members to our fold. We are also fostering strong leadership at the ward and local government levels. The party has fostered strong leadership at ward and local government levels and will continue to do that. This is done by identifying and nurturing leaders who are committed to the party’s vision and ideologies, and who have the skills, experience and character to lead the party. The party has built and is still building alliances with other interest groups, and stakeholders who share its vision and ideologies. The party has immensely been engaging with voters on a regular basis, through a variety of channels, including social media, rallies, town hall meetings, and door-to-door canvassing. This is due to our willingness to listen to voters, understand their concerns, and respond to their needs. The party has also invested in capacity building for leaders at wards and local government levels. I am in politics to engender transformational development across all the sectors of our economy as well as providing social welfare packages. I strongly believe that the welfare of the poor must be paramount, which defines the socialist orientation of our party. I am working with other colleagues towards reducing the number of out-of-school children. I am also working with some other colleagues to provide capacity building and business solution services to women and youth entrepreneurs. What is your take on the continued hold of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos? Do you think the situation will ever change? POLL The APC government in Lagos State has performed below expectation, given its enormous available resources. We all saw the massive rigging and insecurity during the last governorship election in Lagos. The situation will definitely change, as Lagosians are tired of the misrule of the same party which has been ruling as the AD, AC, ACN and APC government in Lagos for over 23 years. What is your view on the recently announced removal of Petroleum Subsidy? Petroleum subsidies are government policies that reduce the cost of petroleum products. These subsidies are often implemented to ensure that petrol remains affordable for households and businesses, especially in developing countries where energy costs can be a significant burden for low-income families and micro businesses. The removal of petroleum subsidies has both pros and cons. On the positive side, removing subsidies can help reduce government spending and free up resources for other priorities, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. It is important to state that our problem is not money, but management and optimum utilisation of money. We are witnesses to the looting of over N100 billion by the former Accountant General of the Federation and the looting of billions by other government officials. So, the imaginary savings will be looted by the ruling class. On the negative side, the removal of petroleum subsidies can lead to higher energy costs for households and businesses, which can put a strain on the economy and lead to social unrest. In addition, removing subsidies can also lead to inflationary pressures, as the cost of transportation and other goods and services that rely on petroleum products increase. So, I am totally against subsidy removal, as it will definitely make life unbearable for the poor masses. A responsible government will not remove subsidies in a nation where 133 million people are multidimensionally poor. Looking at the way President Bola Tinubu announced the removal of oil subsidies, what type of leader do you think he will be? Tinubu didn’t disappoint me. His eight years rule in Lagos was more of authoritarianism. As much as I wish my nation well, I don’t expect any positive change from the government of Bola Tinubu. How do you think the Lagos administration will be in this second term of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu? It won’t be different from the first term. Sanwo-Olu will continue his misrule and lack of transparency in the state. What is your advice to Nigerians, especially the poor masses at this crucial moment of the nation’s history? Here are a few pieces of advice to Nigerians, especially the poor masses, during this crucial moment in the nation’s history. They should stay informed. It is important to stay informed about the latest developments in the country, including political, economic, and social issues. This can help you make informed decisions about your own life and stay prepared for any challenges that may arise. Secondly, they should be resilient. Nigerians are known for their resilience in the face of adversity, and this is a crucial trait to cultivate during difficult times. Focus on your strengths, stay positive, and keep pushing forward, even in the face of obstacles. They should seek support. Don’t be afraid to seek support from family, friends, or professional services, such as mental health counseling or financial assistance. There are many resources available to help you navigate difficult times, and seeking support is a sign of strength, not weakness. They should get involved. As a citizen, you have the power to shape the future of your country. Get involved in your community, join advocacy groups, and exercise your right to vote. By working together, Nigerians can create positive change and build a brighter future for all. They should take care of themselves. It is important to take care of your physical and mental health, especially during times of stress and uncertainty. Make time for self-care activities, such as exercise, meditation, or hobbies, and prioritize your well-being. Simply put, staying informed, being resilient, seeking support, getting involved, and taking care of themselves are some of the key steps Nigerians can take to navigate difficult times and build a better future for themselves and their communities. Finally, Nigerians should be ready to resist all the anti-masses policies of this ruinous government.
