There was palpable confusion on Tuesday, during the ongoing proceedings at the governorship election petition tribunal sitting in Abeokuta metropolis, as a witness of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Olusanya Olatunji, confessed to having lied on oath. Olatunji, a PDP member, who came from Idowa, in Odogbolu LGA, admitted to have deliberately concocted the figures he supplied in his witness statement with regard to Registered voters and PVCs collected in his area. That is even as another witness called by PDP, Abidemi Adenuga, while being crossed examined said the gubernatorial election in the State was held on March 13th instead of 18th. Also, the witness didn’t know what, Petitioner, form EC8A and form EC8B mean, as well as how he came about the figures of PVCs collected as purportedly stated in his witness report. In addition to this and rather amazingly, the PDP witness said she didn’t know the process by which she became a party agent as claimed by the PDP, and even who the respondents in the case are. “Q: Who is the Petitioner in this case? Witness: I don’t know Q: When was the election? POLL Witness: 13th March 2023 Q: Who told you the figures of PVCs collected as stated in your witness statement Witness: I don’t know Q: Do you know Form EC8A? Witness: I don’t know Q: Do you know what Form EC8B is used for? Witness: I don’t know Q: Do you know the process by which you became a party agent? Witness: I don’t know Q: Who are the Respondents in this case? A: I don’t know”.
