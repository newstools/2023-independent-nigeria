IBADAN – The Professional Insurance Ladies Association (PILA) has honoured the founder of Industrial and General Insurance (IGI), the late Remi Olowude, with a posthumous Special Award of Excellence for his moral and financial support to the body during his lifetime. The recognition was part of the body’s 50th-anniversary celebration, held in Lagos recently. Olowude, who died in 2014, was the prestigious insurance company’s Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive Officer. In a letter of invitation sent to the family, signed by Bola Onigbogi and Margaret Moore, Fundraising and Awards Committee Chairman, and PILA’s President respectively, the association said the selection process took time and deliberation. “Late Dr Remi Olowude and the other selected recipients stood out as leaders who have made their mark in their different spheres and who have consistently shown exemplary traits that are worthy of note,” the letter disclosed. The award was received by the wife of the deceased, Bunmi, in the company of Foluso Gbadamosi, Bukky Akomolafe and others. Born in 1951, Olowude was an economist and chartered insurance practitioner who many revered as the expert who changed the face of insurance marketing in Nigeria
