Teenage talent Luka Romero has arrived at the Casa di Cura La Madonnina to undergo his pre-transfer medicals with Milan. The 18-year-old Argentinian winger is currently a free agent after his contract with Lazio drew to a close last week, ending a promising two-year spell in the Italian capital. A youngster brimming with potential, Luka Romero has already trained with the senior Argentina team and scored his debut Serie A goal last season in a 1-0 win over Monza. Gianluca Di Marzio highlights how Luka Romero arrived at the Casa di Cura La Madonnina this morning to carry out his medicals with Milan, ready to join the club on a free transfer. After completing the tests, the 18-year-old will head to Casa Milan to sign his new four-year contract, adding an exciting talent to Stefano Pioliâ€™s squad. Luka Romero made history back in the 2019-20 season, becoming the youngest ever La Liga debutant after coming on against Real Madrid in June 2020 aged 15.
