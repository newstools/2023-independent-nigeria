LAGOS – In a continued effort to eliminate street trading on state highways and major streets in the La­gos metropolis, the Lagos State Taskforce is prepar­ing to crack down on street traders and support other governmental agencies in enforcing the complete ban on street trading in the state. CSP Shola Jejeloye, Chairman of the Task­force, at the Bolade Osho­di Headquarters disclosed this recently. He emphasised that the state government’s com­mitment to ensuring the safety and security of La­gosians while maintaining order on the highways. “It is no longer a secret that the closure of Eko Bridge was a result of ille­gal street trading beneath the bridge, which led to a fire outbreak and subse­quent closure of the bridge for safety reasons. Now that the bridge has been re­opened, we will ensure that these street traders do not cause any further harm to Lagosians.” The Taskforce has been collaborating with sister agencies such as the Lagos State Environmental Sani­tation Corps (LAGESC) in joint operations to eradi­cate the problem of street trading, which obstructs the free movement of vehi­cles and pedestrians along major routes like Oshodi, Ketu, and Ajangbadi. This time, everyone will be ful­ly committed to ensuring compliance throughout the state. Jejeloye explained that the forthcoming enforce­ment exercise is in line with the longstanding La­gos State Government’s Street Trading and Illegal Market Prohibition Law of 2003. This law stipulates a punishment of N90,000 or a six-month jail term for both the buyers and sellers of goods or ser­vices on the streets He ex­pressed concern over the environmental and secu­rity issues associated with street trading, particular­ly the criminal activities that often occur during nighttime. The Chairman appealed to Lagosians to collaborate with the State Government in achieving the vision of transforming Lagos into a mega city, as outlined in the THEMES Agenda of the State.
