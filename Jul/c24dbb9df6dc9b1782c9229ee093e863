IBADAN – The Speaker, Oyo State House of Assembly, Right Honourable Adebo Ogundoyin has assured that the 10th Oyo State House of Assembly will be special in all ramifications. Honourable Ogundoyin stated this over the weekend while featuring on a fresh Fm live interview program, Political Circuit in Ibadan. Hon. Ogundoyin while answering questions from the anchor, Mayor Isaac Brown on his vision for the 10th Oyo State House of Assembly said though the 9th Oyo Assembly did excellently well, this new Assembly in the State will strive to make more impacts in all areas. “Our collective vision is to make the 10th Oyo State House of Assembly a special one. The newly inaugurated 10th Oyo State House is set to make meaningful impacts in all aspects. We have a combination of returning and new lawmakers who are vibrant and intelligent.” Ogundoyin added that as a young parliamentarian just like others, he has learnt the nitty-gritty of law-making with at least five years of experience and he is set to bring it to bear in the 10th Oyo State House of Assembly. “I want to say that the 10th Oyo State House of Assembly may not be about the number of bills passed. But it is going to be about bills that will accelerate all-round development in Oyo State. The bills may be few this time around but we will ensure that they are those that will have direct positive bearings on the lives of the people. Our people must enjoy Omituntun 2.0 more than Omituntun 1.0,” The Speaker said Speaking on the live streaming of the activities of the House, the Speaker assured that this time around all assented bills, motions and resolutions of the House will be on the Assembly’s website. According to him, this will allow members of the public to monitor the activities of the House and also access whatever information they need.
