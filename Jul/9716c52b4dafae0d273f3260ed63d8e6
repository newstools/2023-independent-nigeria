Manchester United are looking to improve their strike-force and the goal keeping departments in the summer transfer window. If reports in the Italian media are anything to go by then Man Utd have made offers for Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana. According to La Repubblica, the Red Devils have presented their first offer to sign the Cameroonian shot stopper. The news source claim United moved in with a bid worth 47 million euros (£40.4million) but Inter Milan decided to turn it down. The Nerazzurri are looking for a fee of 60 million euros (£51.5million) to offload Onana, who was brilliant in his debut campaign at the San Siro. On the other hand, as per Corriere dela Sera, after getting their first bid rejected, the Old Trafford outfit made their second attempt to lure Hojlund from Atalanta. The initial offer was 35 million euros and the most recent offer is 46 million euros (£39.5million) but the Bergamo club also demand 60 million euros for their prized asset. Erik ten Hag needs quality signings at the earliest but in all fairness, Man United have been poor negotiators in the current transfer window. POLL Clubs know how to get the maximum fee from the 20-time English champions. They saw three bids rejected before eventually reaching an agreement with Chelsea to lure Mason Mount and we a similar trend in their efforts to sign Hojlund and Onana. In just over a week, United will face their first pre-season game and they must get key targets as soon as possible.
