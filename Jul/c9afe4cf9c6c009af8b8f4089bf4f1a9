Public finances of governments, businesses and individual citizens of most countries around the world today have had and are still feeling the devastating impacts and economic upheaval caused by crises that could not have been fore­cast few years ago. These crises ranges from the Covid-19 global pandemic, recessions, financial crises, climate change or natural disasters to inflation and energy crises stemming from the war Russian/ Ukraine war and the altered global interest rate land­scape that is making lending to Low Income Countries (LICs) and debt servicing prohibitively expensive. Various governments had to take steps to shield their citizens and economies from the worst effects of these challenges which is taking place against a backdrop of high debt level, limited fiscal spaces and elevated uncertainty that we cannot predict what events may develop next year or the year after so that policy makers can structure public finances with resilience in mind. The shocks that have shaken the global economy in recent years have introduced a new normal for turbulence lifting uncertainty to exceptionally high levels, which in turn hurts economic growth and caused fiscal risks. Fiscal risks that may arise from a range of different sources which can be classified as follow: Economic, Environment, Geopolitical, Technological and So­cietal. World Uncertainty Index 2008 – 2022 (Index, GDP weighted average) Sources: Ahir, Bloom, and Furceri (2022), Chart of the Week Jan.2023 What is Fiscal Risk ? POLL Fiscal risks are deviations from fiscal outcomes expected at the time of budget formulation or other forecasts. This deviation might create significant impact on government finances and impair the capacity of governments to use fiscal policy to stabilize economic activity and support long-term growth. (World Bank 2019). Thus, Fiscal Risk Management refers to comprehensive analysis, disclo­sure and management of fiscal risks. Fiscal risks are factors that may cause fiscal outcomes to deviate from expectations or forecasts. i.e. all those factors that can cause government finances to deviate from what we expect.(IMF Lesley Fisher and Amanda Sayegh 2022). Fiscal risks refer to the uncertainty associated with the outlook in public finances and can be defined as the probability of signifi­cant differences between actual and expected fiscal performance, over the short to medium-term horizon (Kopits 2014). Fiscal risks what are they? Macroeconomic shocks Growth, Exchange rates, Interest rates, and Commodity prices Contingent Liabilities, Explicit/implicit, Guarantees, SOEs & PPPs and Legal claims Tail-risk events Pandemic, Nature & climate disasters, Societal & Conflicts, Technological Contingent Liabilities Debt managers and fiscal risks mangers are concerned about risks from contingent liabilities – explicit, as well as implicit con­tingent liabilities from debt of state-owned enterprises and subna­tional governments, as well as financial sector risks and natural disaster. Explicit Contingent Liabilities Legal or contractual financial arrangements that give rise to conditional requirements to make payments of economic value. The requirements become effective if one or more stipulated con­ditions arise. Guarantee on PPP Guarantee on sub-national or SOE’s Loans Guarantee on Insurance Programme Settlement of Investment disputes Projected Shortfalls in Pension Schemes Implicit Contingent Liabilities Bailout of Sub-national entities, SOE’s losses and arears Bail out of Banks & microfinance institutions Bailout of private enterprises (Too big to fail) Settlement of Investment disputes Cost of recovery from Natural Disasters, Pandemic etc iKey Message Contingent liabilities have been one of the largest sources of fiscal risk in Africa. In several cases, materialization of guarantees, failure to disclose some SOEs debt and arrears, exchange rate depreciation and lack of capacity to prepare for fiscal risk has led to large increases in public debt. Why Fiscal Risks Matter Sources of Fiscal Risk: Macroeconomic Shocks Heatmap outlook for selected key macroeconomic indicators of Africa countries, average, 2023–24 Fiscal Risk Management Process Key Message Fiscal risk management require that risks to the public finances are identified, analyzed, and managed and disclosed. In addition, the fiscal decision on managing fiscal risks across the public sector is effectively coordinated. Step 1: Identify and Quantify Step 2: Mitigate Step 3: Provision Step 4: Accommodate Residual & create space Step 5: Disclose Legal Framework for Fiscal Risk Management (Republic of Sierra Leone) The Public Financial Management Act, 2016 mandate the Min­ister of Finance to: PFM Act mandate – Development of government’s fiscal policy – Monitor and management fiscal risks Through Fiscal Strategy Statement in addition to the budget Medium Term Budgetary Framework Make forecasts of macroeconomic and fiscal indicators Actual outcomes of these indicators and an explanation of the reasons for significant differences between them, if any Fiscal risk statement; (j) ceilings on total expenditures details for 3 years The act requires that Fiscal Strategy Statement laid be­fore Parliament Minister shall identify and analyze risks which may have a material effect on the fiscal outlook.

Liquidity risks and arrears accumulation, which are a conse­quence of adverse revenue and expenditure developments and uncompensated public service obligations where entities are un­able to raise revenues or recover costs. These may result in a call on Government – in case the SC fails to have sufficient working capital – to finance short-term obligations, whereby debts continue to accumulate, become uncollectible, or are written off. 3. Direct and contingent liabilities of which the Government may have an explicit legal obligation (such as a loan, guarantee, or contractual obligation as part of an investment project) or an implicit obligation, such as supporting an SC facing liquid­ity problems, given the strategic importance that it plays in the economy. Challenges Adherence to the Laws: fiscal discipline is weak and remains a concern; Absence of an overarching and coordinated PFM strategy in some countries; Capacity and skill gaps in Fiscal risk management strategy de­velopment to comprehensively record and monitor fiscal risks and; Inadequate ICT infrastructure in the public sector to support rollout of computerized platforms for effective records of contin­gent liabilities and other fiscal risks variables; Sub-National Governments: in some cases, there is lack of com­prehensive information on the financial condition and performance of sub-national governments individually and as a consolidate sector; • Public Corporations: Many governments don’t regularly pub­lish comprehensive information on the financial performance of public corporations, including any quasi-fiscal activity Global landscape is dominated by manifesting risk and other external shocks. Conclusion While ongoing shocks unfold, the Africa stands at a crossroads. As we enter a low-growth, low-investment and low-cooperation era, countries need to : Establish clear accountability for monitoring, managing and reporting contingent liabilities; Ensure a monitoring mechanism for regular review of: (i) the potential for risk realization as new information becomes avail­able; (ii) whether existing policies remain appropriate; and (iii) whether existing mitigation measures are adequate; Establish intra-governmental coordination mechanisms to as­sess and monitor risks and policy responses, particularly between finance and economic ministries and central banks to monitor and manage financial sector exposures; Parliamentary involvement in monitoring the guarantees given and called as well as the impact on the economy and employment of support measures will help provide additional legitimacy; Ensure the full disclosure of all fiscal measures, be they direct or contingent, on-budget or off-budget; Enhance capacity to mitigate and manage risks. The need for training and retraining on the World Bank Fiscal Risk Assessment (FRA)framework, and the IMF Fiscal rule toolkit Better integrate fiscal risk analysis into fiscal policymaking: fis­cal frameworks could be strengthened, together with the analysis and understanding of these risks and the reporting of Contingent Liabilities. • Musa, Director General, West African Institute for Financial and Economic Management (WAIFEM)
