The Spanish military is moving an air defense system stationed in Latvia to neighboring Lithuania to help protect the NATO summit being held there next week, the Spanish embassy announced in Vilnius on Monday. “We can confirm that Spain is contributing to the security of the Vilnius NATO Summit with a NASAMS air defense unit,” the embassy told the BNS news agency. The NATO summit is set to take place in Vilnius on July 11 and 12. Germany has transferred Patriot air defense units to Lithuania to help protect the summit. NASAMS, or the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, was jointly developed by Norway and the United States. It is designed to counterattack from the air by drones, missiles or planes.
