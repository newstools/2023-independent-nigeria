The United States Central Command (Centcom) on Sunday confirmed that a drone airstrike from Friday successfully killed an ISIS leader in Syria. The official statement announcing the news was shared across various platforms, including Centcom’s official Twitter account. In it, the agency confirmed the death of ISIS leader Usamah Al-Muhajir, with the airstrike taking place in an unspecified part of Eastern Syria. “This will disrupt and degrade ISIS’s ability to plan and conduct terror attacks,” the official statement read. “However, CENTCOM’s operations against ISIS, alongside partner forces in Iraq and Syria, will continue in order to achieve the group’s enduring defeat.” The statement further claimed that the MQ-9 drones, also known as “reapers,” involved in the strike had previously been engaged in a harassing encounter with Russian crafts. The statement continued: “The strike on Friday was conducted by the same MQ-9s that had, earlier in the day, been harassed by Russian aircraft in an encounter that had lasted almost two hours.” Centcom added that the strike is believed to have been carried out with no collateral harm to civilians, though the coalition in the region is currently assessing any reports made about civilian harm or death caused by the incident. “We have made it clear that we remain committed to the defeat of ISIS throughout the region,” General Michael “Erik” Kurilla, commander of Centcom, said. “ISIS remains a threat, not only to the region but well beyond.” Little information is currently available about Al-Muhajir and what his actions were in Syria.
