BENIN  – Prof. Godwin Aondohemba Vaasen of the Edo State Univer­sity, Uzairue has proposed us­ing ethnic militia movements as state police to supplement the efforts of the Nigerian Po­lice Force (NPF). Prof. Vaasen also recom­mended better cooperation between members of the ju­diciary and the police in order to fight crime more effectively and at the grassroots level. The don made the recom­mendation while delivering the 19th Inaugural Lecture of the Edo State University, Uzairue titled: ‘Transforming Ethnic Militia Movement to State Po­lice: Towards Combating the Security Challenges in Con­temporary Nigeria. The Professor of History and International Studies de­scribed the police as an indis­pensable part of the society; adding that they have been do­ing their best to maintain peace and security in Nigeria. He also said that despite their efforts, they (police) are still limited by certain factors in the performance of their du­ties hence, the call for the use of ethnic militia movement to complement their efforts. “The positive attributes of this militia movement includ­ing their occasioned control of crime and their services as pressure groups for their communities is crucial for the attainment of peace if proper­ly tackled, as their use as states police force will go a long way and as an antidote to the securi­ty challenges in Nigeria”. Prof. Vaasen, a former lec­turer at the Nigerian Police Academy however stated that due to the possibility of some state governments misusing the state police to perhaps in­timidate their political oppo­nents, legal backing should be sought before their establish­ment.
