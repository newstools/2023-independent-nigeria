LAGOS  – The Coalition for Tinu­bu/Shettima Progressive Group Worldwide has ex­pressed its deep apprecia­tion for the commendable work carried out by Pres­ident Bola Ahmed Tinubu under the leadership of the APC government. While the group ac­knowledged their valuable contributions during the campaign, they also ex­pressed a desire to be duly recognised and compensat­ed for their efforts. Founder and President, Prince (Dr.) Adelodun Ad­eniyi Akeem, emphasised the group’s pivotal role as the vanguard of the Tinu­bu/Shettima group since its inception. He attributed the group’s success to their unwavering support, which resulted in the APC’s resounding vic­tory in the general election. Prince Adelodun re­called a significant meeting at Asiwaju President’s resi­dence, attended by the pres­ident’s daughter, Chief Mrs. Folashade Tinubu-Ojo, fur­ther solidifying their claim to recognition and appoint­ment. He said the group firmly believes that their contribu­tions warrant compensa­tion, as they were among the first to endorse the can­didacy of Tinubu/Shettima when many others were skeptical. They said they invested substantial finan­cial resources, amounting to millions of naira, dedi­cated their time, and even faced personal risks, all driven by their unwavering faith in the vision of Tinu­bu/Shettima. He also highlighted their official registration with the APC and their wide­spread presence across 15 Nigerian states, emphasis­ing their credibility and un­derstanding of their roles in the victory. “It is important to dispel misconceptions that the group received monetary compensation, as their ac­tions were fueled solely by their commitment to the cause. They embarked on extensive campaigns across numerous states, including the FCT Abuja, and main­tain that evidence exists to support their claims,” he said. POLL Prince Adelodun further asserted that the group had no regrets or disap­pointment in supporting the candidacy of Tinubu/ Shettima.
