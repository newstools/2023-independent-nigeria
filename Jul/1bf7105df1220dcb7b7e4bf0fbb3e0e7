•Says Nigerian Navy Witnessed Remarkable Advancements During His Tenure LAGOS – Former Chief of Naval Staff (CNS), Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo, considers Nigeria’s removal from the list of piracy-prone countries by the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) as his greatest achievement during his tenure. Speaking at his Pulling/Sailing Out Ceremony held by the Nigerian Navy, Gambo highlighted the significance of this accomplishment, which took place in 2022, as a turning point in the nation’s maritime security narrative after 27 years. During his speech, Gambo reflected on the progress made by the Nigerian Navy in the past two and a half years. He acknowledged the ever-dynamic and transnational nature of maritime threats and credited the Navy’s efforts for Nigeria’s exit from the list of piracy-prone countries. This achievement had not been realized in the previous 27 years, marking a significant milestone for the country. He also praised the Navy’s success in combating illegal oil bunkering through Operation DAKATAR DA BARAWO. By leveraging technology, the Nigerian Navy was able to conduct more effective and cost-efficient operations, reducing the need to deploy capital ships extensively. The Navy’s enhanced operational capabilities allowed for the prompt arrest and prosecution of maritime offenders, including pirates and sea robbers, through the Suppression of Piracy and Other related Maritime Offences (SPOMO) Act of 2019. Gambo expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to serve as CNS and thanked former President Muhammadu Buhari for the privilege. He also extended his appreciation and well wishes to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. POLL He noted that throughout his tenure, the Nigerian Navy witnessed significant advancements in operations, logistics, manpower development, and personnel welfare. The former CNS highlighted achievements in anti-crude oil theft, anti-piracy and counterinsurgency operations, fleet renewal, and infrastructural development. These efforts bolstered the Navy’s capacity to project force across the Gulf of Guinea, supporting neighboring countries and international partners. Gambo attributed these accomplishments to teamwork, integrity, and professionalism. Gambo commended Rear Admiral Emmanuel Ogalla, the Twenty-Second indigenous CNS, for honoring him despite his numerous official responsibilities. He expressed his gratitude and assured Ogalla of his prayers, best wishes, and ongoing support. Gambo also urged all Naval officers and ratings to extend the same level of excellence and collaboration to his successor. Reflecting on his journey in the military, which began with officer cadet training in 1984, Gambo expressed fulfillment despite the challenges and thrilling experiences he encountered along the way.He expressed immense joy at departing from a Navy that is now stronger and better equipped in its increased strength and enhanced capabilities to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities for national security and economic progress. The Pulling/Sailing Out Ceremony included a Parade, March Past, and the symbolic act of Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo’s departure from his role.
