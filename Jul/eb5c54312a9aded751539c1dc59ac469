ABUJA – The Federal Capital Terri­tory Internal Revenue Ser­vice (FCT-IRS), in collabo­ration with the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN), has begun training of another 200 ser­vice personnel on tax audit and investigation. This is in line with the Service’s mandate to en­sure a steady increase in revenue generation in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) by building capacity of officials. Abdullahi, in a state­ment made available to newsmen on Monday in Abuja, by Mustapha Su­maila, Head, Corporate Communications, FCT-IRS, explained that this training could not have come at a better time than now as all efforts are geared towards harmonisation of all reve­nues and centralise collec­tion to the FCT-IRS, hence the need to have skilled and equipped workforce that would drive the process. He said this year’s train­ing would bring the total to 400 so far on this collabora­tion, as 200 personnel were trained last year, stressing that the Service, under his leadership, would continue to partner with relevant professional bodies within and outside the country to enhance the productivity of the workforce. According to him, tax of­ficials need technical and verbal skills to effectively audit and interact with tax­payers, especially the high network individuals and politically-exposed persons to boost compliance. “The responsibility of the Service is key to the success of the FCT Admin­istration. Therefore, skill­ful tax men are needed to rapidly grow the tax net, especially now that expec­tations are high on revenue generating agencies. “I urge you to listen at­tentively and participate fully in this course. When you come out of this train­ing, it is expected you make meaningful contributions and add value to what we are doing. That is the es­sence of you being here”.
