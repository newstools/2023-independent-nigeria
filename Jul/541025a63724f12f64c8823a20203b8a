Dusan Vlahovic could soon be on the way out of Juventus, with multiple Premier League clubs interested in a move this summer, Gazzetta dello Sport suggests. The 23-year-old Serbian striker struggled to show his best under Massimiliano Allegri last season, netting just 10 goals in 27 Serie A appearances. Juventus have already made it clear that they’d be willing to listen to offers for Vlahovic this summer, keen to lower their wage bill and kickstart their post-Andrea Agnelli era. Page six of today’s Gazzetta dello Sport details how Vlahovic is a popular figure in the Premier League, with three clubs in particular considering making a move this summer: Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United. The former are the most interested and could make an approach after selling Romelu Lukaku to Inter, whilst Spurs may be forced to pick up a new striker in the coming months should they sell Harry Kane. The Red Devils are also in the market for a centre forward and have seemingly given up on Napoli’s Victor Osimhen.
