The Security arm of the National Assembly otherwise referred to as Serjeant-at-arms on Tuesday prevented accredited journalists from different media organisations from covering the Senate plenary on Tuesday. One of their operatives with a name tag, Dengi, insisted that he would not allow any journalist from accessing the gallery of the hallowed chamber. Attempts to let him know why journalists should cover the open plenary fell on deaf ears as the overzealous security operative locked the door to the gallery and walked away. After about 30 minutes, a senior operative of the Serjeant-at-arms who did not wear a name tag, came in company with the overzealous Dengi to meet the stranded journalists. The senior Serjeant-at-arms resolved that only a few journalists would be accommodated because of the limited space at the makeshift gallery. As of the time of filing this report, about 25 out of the 90 journalists accredited to cover the Senate were allowed to enter the gallery. The situation was worsened by the fact that the television from where journalists monitor plenary proceedings at the Senate Press centre is not functional as of the time of filing this report.
