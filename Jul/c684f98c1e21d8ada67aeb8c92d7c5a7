Rev Fr Hyacinth Alia, the Governor of Benue State has condemned in very strong terms the killings that took place in Akpuuna, Mbaterem, Ukum Local Government Area (LGA) of the state by armed bandits on Saturday. Meanwhile, the Benue State Police Command has confirmed the attack on the communities in a statement made available to Daily Independent in Makurdi on Sunday by the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Sewuese Anene. According to Anene, the police and other sister agencies have brought the situation under control. However, while the State Governor has assured of the swift intervention by Government, Fr. Alia has sued for calm and advised the people of Sankera axis (Ukum, Katsina-Ala and Logo LGAs) to assist security agencies with useful information that would assist it in putting similar incidences under check. In a statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the Governor, Sir Kula Tersoo said, “The Governor of Benue State, Rev Fr Dr. Hyacinth Iormem Alia condemns in strong terms the unprovoked attack on Ukum Local Government Area of Benue State. “Scores of people have been reportedly killed in cold blood at Akpuuna village in Mbaterem, Ukum LGA by armed men suspected to be hoodlums. “Governor Hyacinth Alia said it is disappointing and quite disheartening to receive the news that innocent and law-abiding citizens have been attacked and killed in cold blood for no cause. “He (Alia) expressed total displeasure over what he described as a heinous crime and a grave sin against God and mankind, and directed security agents to arrest those behind the unlawful act and bring them to book. POLL “The Governor (also) sent his condolences to those whose loved ones were killed in the attack and prayed God to comfort them.” Recall that Daily Independent had reported that armed bandits had attacked Apkuuna, a community in Ukum LGA of the state, where they shot to death about 28 persons.
