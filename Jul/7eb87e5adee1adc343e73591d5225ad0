ABUJA  – President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has assured the business com­munity of his government’s commitment to policy con­sistency and better business climate to attract investment. The president spoke on Monday while receiving the delegation of the Shell Petro­leum Development Compa­ny (SPDC) led by the Global Upstream Director, Ms. Zoe Yujnock at the State House, Abuja. President Tinubu wel­comed the SPDC’s offer for more investments in the Ni­gerian oil and gas sector, add­ing that such investments are needed now more than ever, to enable government meet its obligations. The president recalled that attracting fresh investment was “a promise I made person­ally to Nigerians. Whatever it takes, I will fulfill that promise to Nigerians.” President Tinubu reiter­ated that Nigeria is ready for business, assuring the Shell management and other inves­tors of his administration’s willingness to maintain an open-door policy and address their concerns. “We are open for business. We are serious. I give you the assurance of consistency in policy,” he said. The president also assured that his government was removing all forms of bottle­necks in order to ensure Ni­geria becomes an attractive investment destination. Addressing the president earlier, Ms. Yujnock applauded what she described as “incred­ibly strong start” of the Tinu­bu presidency and expressed optimism that the “bold” steps taken by the government would renew Nigeria’s pride of place as an investment des­tination. POLL Yujnock said SPDC was willing to ramp up investment in the country especially in the areas of gas and deep-water as­sets by pumping in billions of dollars. She said Nigeria remains a strategic investment country for the company in view of the long history between the two entities and the prospects held by the county’s oil and gas sector.
