Nigerian business tycoon and renowned philanthropist, Honorable Dorume Oghenero, has made known his plans to provide and distribute relief materials to residents of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps around Abuja. He said arrangements had been concluded for his team to visit some IDP camps on June 14th and 15th, respectively, to distribute materials. The camps scheduled for these visits, according to him, are the Area One and Lugbe IDP Camps in Abuja. Materials to be distributed include exercise books, clothes, gallons of palm oil, noodles, toilet rolls, tubers of yam, milk tins, bags of rice and sachets of seasoning cubes, and bags of sachet water. Dorume Oghenero said some comedians and DJs would provide comic relief and music. “This is just the first stage of the distribution project; the second phase will be when we also plan to visit IDP camps in Jos, Plateau state,” he said. Most of the occupants of the IDP camps are people and families from towns and villages ravaged by the Shite sect Boko Haram. He said the focus will be orphans, women, and children between 6 and 13 in these camps.
