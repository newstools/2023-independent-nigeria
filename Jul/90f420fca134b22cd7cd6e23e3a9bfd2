MAKURDI – About 28 persons were on Saturday feared dead in an attack on Zaki Akpuuna 1, a community in Mbaterem district of Ukum Local Government Area (LGA) of Benue State. Daily Independent learned that the attack may have been perpetrated by bandits that have previously terrorised the area in recent months. According to our findings, the bandits had invaded two other villages where they killed mostly youths and set houses in the villages ablaze. Speaking to Daily Independent in Makurdi on the phone on Saturday, a competent source in the area said 24 corpses were recovered after the attack, while another source said the number could be higher. One of them said, “At least, 24 bodies have been recovered and the search is still on to find missing persons”, while the other said “The exact number of casualties could be more because the military are currently exchanging gun fire with the bandits.” Narrating the incident that preceded the attacks, one of the locals explained that the bandits stormed the area on Saturday morning and started shooting sporadically, causing pandemonium. He further observed that after the attack by the bandits, corpses that fell to the hail of bullets littered the area. Daily Independent however gathered that as the bandits fled the scene of the incident, they ran into the military and engaged them in a gun duel. POLL However, the source said due to the hot exchange of gunfire, residents fled the scene of the attack to Tine Nine community, adding that it was difficult to ascertain the level of casualty. Efforts to get the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Benue Command, SP Sewuese Anene as well as the spokesman for Operation Whirl Strike (OPWS) Flight Lieutenant DO Oquah proved abortive. As at the time of compiling this report, the duo were yet to respond to calls and messages put through them.
