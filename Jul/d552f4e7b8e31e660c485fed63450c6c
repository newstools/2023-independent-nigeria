A group, Abuja Original inhabitants Youth Empowerment Organization (AOIYEO), has concluded arrangements to float a talent hunt aimed at engaging the youth positively and making them more productive. The President of the group, Ambassador Isaac David, who hinted this while briefing journalists said the programme when fully implemented, would take off the youths of the streets and reduce crime. According to him, the idea is to bring the youths in the Federal Capital Territory together and teach them how to discover themselves. He expressed optimism that the talents discovered through the programme would be converted to the benefit the society in general. “Considering the percentage of our youth roaming the streets to search for job that did not exist is worrisome and we have looked at it with the mind to do something about it because if nothing is done coupled with existing security challenge, it is very likely that the government may not be able to contend with side effects of it.” “While at the same time we would try as much as possible to ensure that their mindsets are drastically changed from usual reliance on government to provide jobs for them because the show is planned to provide a platform whereby these youth would begin to see themselves as producers of jobs through their creativity and productivity and this would by extension avail them the opportunity to contribute to the development of the nation.” Isaac explained  that this step has potentials to change the narration among the youth from traditional belief of what the country can do for me to what I can do for my country and it was on this background that he called out on government, companies and individuals to come out to support this programme through sponsorship, adding that this has a propensity to discourage the crimes from taking over the mindsets of the youth. “We are calling on our government, companies and individuals to come and join hands with the AOIYEO to connect these youth to global investment and entrepreneurship space to first of all reduce crime rates and also give them opportunity to contribute their quota to the development of the society,” he reiterated.
