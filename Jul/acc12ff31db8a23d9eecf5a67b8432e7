These collaborations have been vital to our adoption of technology as a tool to enhance revenue generation and streamline processes. “We will strengthen these partnerships and engage with stakeholders through revitalized platforms. By promoting dialogue, we can resolve disputes and advance mutually beneficial solutions that lead to more efficient and effective service. The Nigeria Customs Service will continue to treat its esteemed stakeholders as partners who have a stake in our success.” The Ag. CGC stated that his administration is firmly committed to fairness and equity, and shall treat all stakeholders, traders, and officers alike with impartiality and respect, adding that decisions and actions will be guided by principles of transparency and discipline. While noting that the conduct of Officers shapes the public’s perception of the Service, he urged them to strive to uphold the highest standards of professionalism and ethical behaviour, and will not tolerate indiscipline. “My predecessor had taken significant steps towards Customs modernization, and it is our duty to build on those gains.

All these efforts will be channeled towards ensuring that the real potentials of the Service are achieved.” Adeniyi, who described the new Customs Act as a significant milestone in the journey towards Customs modernization, said it marks a pivotal moment in the Service’s efforts to enhance trade facilitation, streamline procedures, and strengthen enforcement measures.

I assure you that we are fully committed to the successful implementation of the new Customs Act. “We will work diligently to familiarize our officers and stakeholders with its provisions, ensuring its effective application across all our operations.
