YENAGOA – The Bayelsa Development Ini­tiative (BDI) has criticised the state governor, Douye Diri, for the continuous ban on night operations of commercial tricy­cles, also popularly called Keke, in the Yenagoa metropolis. The BDI, in a statement is­sued by its secretary, Michael Sam Rodamini, said it was in­sensitive and unimaginable for the governor to have allowed a restriction, which was supposed to have been a stop-gap measure, to last beyond one month. Diri had on April 20 imposed an eleven-hour ban on commer­cial tricycle operations from 6pm to 7am after a violent clash between the youths of Yenizue- Epie in the Yenagoa Local Gov­ernment Area and Keke riders resulted loss of lives, including a youth from the community and one rider. Rodamini said for Diri to have feigned ignorance of the overall destructive impact of his ban on the general econo­my, especially on nightlife, was a confirmation of his alleged lack of capacity and cluelessness in handling issues affecting Bayel­sa State. While condemning the inci­dent that led to the ban, he said it should have since been lifted to ease the pains of the helpless masses, who did not have pri­vate vehicles to undertake their activities after 7pm. He said since Keke had be­come the only popular means of transport in the state, partic­ularly for the masses, the ban had worsened the condition of the poor and made quick re­sponses to emergency situations difficult. Rodamini said for Diri to have allowed the restriction to linger even in the face of ongoing inclement weather caused by the rainy season was a demonstration of his alleged absolute lack of care and con­cern for the common people of the state. He further said the group had received reports of many residents attacked and robbed by criminal elements while trekking on dark, lonely roads and streets at night to their des­tinations. POLL He observed that the ban had increased the insecurity in the state, especially in view of the pitch darkness that usually en­velops the state at night follow­ing dysfunctional streetlights across the entire capital city.
