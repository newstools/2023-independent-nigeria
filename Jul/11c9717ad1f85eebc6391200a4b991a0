Dr. Samuel Ibiyemi, a Nige­rian journalist, publisher of Nigerian News Direct newspaper, and politician has been reported dead. He reportedly died on Tuesday afternoon at the Babcock University Teaching Hos­pital, Ilishan Remo of pul­monary embolism. Ibiyemi, who attended Obafemi Awolowo Universi­ty (OAU) between 1991 and 1995 graduated with a degree in Economics before proceed­ing to the University of Lagos where he earned a master’s degree in Economics in 1998. He started his journalism ca­reer with Industrial Leaders Magazine as a staff writer. In 2000, he joined Financial Standard where he was Dep­uty Editor until 2009 before switching to Nigerian Tri­bune serving as Group Busi­ness Editor between 2010 and 2011. In March 2011, Ibiyemi established Nigerian News Direct Newspaper working as Editor-in-Chief of the paper. In a condolence message to his family and media colleagues, the Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun de­scribed his death as shocking and stated that he was a bril­liant and versatile journalist, who deployed his wealth of experience in the profession to better the society. He said the late publisher was a stickler for the truth, noting that through his me­dium, he contributed his own quota to the economic and political development of Nigeria. “He was quick to realise the business aspect of jour­nalism, hence, his foray into publishing. Through NewsDi­rect, a refreshing newspaper, Dr. Ibiyemi brought to bear his professionalism and busi­ness acumen. “His death is a huge loss to his family and the journalism profession. His legacies are immense and indelible.”
