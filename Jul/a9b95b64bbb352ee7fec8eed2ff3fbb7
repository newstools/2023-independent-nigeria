The National Drug Law En­forcement Agency (NDLEA) and the National Crime Agen­cy of the United Kingdom have recommitted to taking battles to the doorsteps of drug cartels as part of efforts to stamp out organized crimes in Nigeria and the UK. The new commitment was the highlight of remarks by the Chairman/Chief Execu­tive Officer of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd), and David Cater, Re­gional Manager, West Afri­ca, NCA, at the signing of a renewed Memorandum of Understanding between the two agencies at the NDLEA headquarters in Abuja on Tuesday 4th July. According to Marwa, “This renewed MoU will definitely and inevitably propel high in­telligence driven operational tentacles that will seek out the most complex organised criminal networks, no matter their hiding place, to face the wrath of the law.” He said there are great ex­pectations in the NCA’s upcom­ing project with the agency’s re­branded Criminal Intelligence Task Force (CITF), stating that, “I look forward, with great op­timism, to the requisite special­ist capabilities this project will provide to the CITF officials to target and disrupt drug traf­ficking cartels in our country, the West Africa sub-region and beyond. “Our overwhelming grat­itude goes to the Government of the United Kingdom for its continued technical support to the agency. Also worthy of ap­preciation is the commendable efforts of the dedicated UK NCA personnelwhich, nodoubt, have inspired the Agency’s CITF of­ficials with deepened enthusi­asmtotackleSeriousOrganized Crimes frontally.” While acknowledging that organised crime is a dynam­ic and complex phenomenon that does not recognise bor­ders thereby posing grave threat to life and property in both countries, the NDLEA boss said, “It is therefore, im­perative to aggressively seek proactive ways of managing intelligence and enhancing capabilities for disrupting transnational organised crime syndicates, thereby justifying the need to sustain the renewal of this memo­randum of understanding which is another significant milestone in our collaborative efforts to combat organised criminal groups.”
