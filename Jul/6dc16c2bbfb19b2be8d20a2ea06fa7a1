LAGOS  – Otunba Segun Runsewe, the Di­rector-General of the National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC) has commended Mr. Seyi Makinde, the Oyo State Governor for “strategically” creating a sepa­rate Ministry of Tourism. Runsewe also said that time has come for Nigeria to take the cultural tourism business seri­ously and give it all the political and financial push necessary to derive the expected gains. Runsewe in a statement to journalists in Lagos, said that creation of the Ministry of Tour­ism by the Oyo State Government was not only cheerful and inter­esting, but also a strategic effort to promote and market the cultural tourism economy of the state. According to him, the decision would make Oyo State a destina­tion rich in culture, history and tradition. Runsewe further challenged other governors in the state to properly situate the strength of the tourism economy, drive it through an exclusive process and engagements and partner with the private sector tourism practitioners. He said: “What the governor did in Oyo state amounts to a deep thought through action plan, and I commend him for that boldness in decision making. If we truly must harness the gains of tour­ism in Nigeria, we should be bold to have a stand-alone Ministry of Tourism, and I must thank Gov­ernor makinde for setting the ball rolling. “Honestly, I am happy at what is coming out from Oyo state, and once it takes off and is adequately funded and with the right man­power, a leadership that can run the distance, Oyo State definitely will be the right place to visit. No doubt that with the state being peaceful, united and secured by Governor Seyi Makinde, the state surely will have plenty of experi­ences to share and market.” Recall that Makinde recently repositioned the state tourism economy by separating tourism from the State Ministry of Infor­mation, Tourism and Culture.
