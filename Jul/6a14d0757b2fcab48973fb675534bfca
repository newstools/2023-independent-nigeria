Their presence will undoubtedly add depth and nostalgia to the new season, as they bring a wealth of experience and familiarity to the screen. However, to ensure the storyline remains relevant and engaging for today’s audience, Ripples will also introduce a fresh infusion of talent. These new faces, such as Tope Olowoniyan, Vine Ogulu, Ian Wordi, and others will be stepping into the shoes once filled by Genevieve Nnaji, Sola Foluso, Patrick Doyle and RMD, among others.

Tope Olowoniyan steps into the complex character of Doris Dehinde-Phillips, a young woman burdened by the weight of her prestigious family name. Born into affluence and responsibility, Doris grew up in an environment where image was paramount, but healthy relationships were scarce. Raised by a grandmother who treated her like a business project, Doris developed a deep resentment towards her own grandmother, Leslie Dehinde-Phillips, the family matriarch. Doris’ journey is fueled by a need for independence and the longing to create a family of her own. When her grandmother passes away, Doris is unexpectedly thrust into a position of power and the fight to protect a family legacy she never knew she desired. Tope Olowoniyan’s portrayal of Doris promises to bring forth the complexities of her character, showcasing her determination to overcome challenges, reclaim her identity, and redefine the meaning of family. POLL Playing the enigmatic Alex Idia is Vine Ogulu. Born to humble and hardworking parents, Alex grew up in poverty, fueling his determination to break free from his circumstances and attain wealth by any means necessary. Alex has honed his skills over the years, crafting a persona that belies his humble origins and presents him as a person born into privilege. Smart, quick-witted, and suave, Alex is a seasoned manipulator, using his cunning to navigate through life to get what he wants. Furthermore, Alex was Doris’s lover, the embodiment of her free-spirited desires and the one she was willing to abandon her family name for. However, as the story unfolds, hidden truths about Alex begin to surface, testing their relationship and forcing Doris to question everything she thought she wanted. In the revival of Ripples, Vine Ogulu breathes life into the complex character of Alex Idia, infusing him with the necessary charisma and edginess. His portrayal promises to showcase the duality of Alex’s personality, leaving viewers captivated by his charm while simultaneously fearing the danger he poses. Ian Wordi steps into the shoes of Richard Ogaga, a dedicated Police Officer with an unwavering commitment to his work. Unlike many of his colleagues, Richard approaches his role with diligence and a sense of responsibility, earning him the coveted position of Public Relations Officer of the Police in Lagos State. However, his devotion to his job comes at a great personal cost as he tragically loses his wife due to the demanding hours he puts into his work. Haunted by guilt and feeling responsible for his wife’s death, Richard embarks on a relentless pursuit of justice. He becomes consumed by solving what he believes to be her murder, along with other cases that are part of an elaborate cover-up. Ian Wordi brings depth and intensity to the character of Richard, showcasing the character’s determination to uncover the truth in his unwavering pursuit of justice. With Tope Olowoniyan, Ian Wordi, David Abua, Debby Felix and Vine Ogulu at the forefront, the new generation of talents in Ripples takes on the monumental task of filling the shoes of Genevieve Nnaji and RMD. Their performances promise to captivate audiences, providing a seamless transition between the iconic characters of the past and the dynamic, complex characters of the present.
