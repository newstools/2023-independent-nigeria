The All Progressives Congress (APC) Professionals’ Council has congratulated President Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his emergence as the new Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The council says the President’s emergence is a clear testimony that Nigeria is getting the deserved recognition among the regional blocs and across the continent of Africa. Recall that the Nigerian leader’s emergence was announced at the 63rd Ordinary Session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS in Guinea Bissau on Sunday. In a congratulatory message made available to Daily Independent, the National Director General of APC Professionals Council, Seyi Bamigbade said that “This is the beginning of fresh focus and a renewed direction for ECOWAS,” expressing hope that the Nigerian President will galvanize the strength of the regional body to pursue a common agenda that will enhance its security and economic prosperity. “We are hopeful that as a democrat, His Excellency, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, will lead this great body to harness its numerous potentials that will undoubtedly be for the good of individual member countries and the region as a whole”, Bamigbade stated. Tinubu takes over from President Umaro Embalo of Guinea Bissau as ECOWAS chair. The 63rd Ordinary Session summit was the first engagement of Tinubu within the African continent since he assumed office on May 29, 2023, succeeding former President Muhammadu Buhari.
