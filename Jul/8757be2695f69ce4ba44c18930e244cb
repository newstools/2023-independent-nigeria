KANO – Kano State Governor, Abba Kabir Yusuf, on Sunday declared that his administration was not pursuing political vendetta against anyone, but working to­wards the progress of the state. Yusuf, otherwise known as Abba Gida-Gida, in his speech while receiving the Emir of Gaya, Alhaji Aliyu Ibrahim Abdulkadir, who paid a Sallah homage, challenged critics to keep records of his work and judge him after he has finished his tenure. Yusuf’s reaction might not be unconnected to the outrage that greeted his administration’s pol­icy reversal, mass sack of civil servants employed by his prede­cessor, demolition of structures in public space over the last 30 days in office. In a statement signed by his spokesman, Hisham Habib, was made available to newsmen in Kano, the governor lamented: “Why should anyone in power take public property and convert it for personal use.” Habib quoted his principal in the statement to have tasked cab­inet members to liaise with the council chairmen in the various local government areas to find out critical issues for govern­ment’s attention. Habib said Governor Yusuf, while addressing the first-class Emir, also directed the Commis­sioner of Health, Dr. Abubakar Labaran, to work round the clock to ensure the smooth res­toration of the health services at Hasiya Bayero Paediatric Hospi­tal in a fortnight. Habib quoted his principal to have said his administration will ensure that free maternity policy is implemented effec­tively.
