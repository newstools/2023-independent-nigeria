Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie has lent his voice to those of others who are calling for the release of the the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu. Edochie, who is also a politician, described his call for Mr Kanu’s release as a humble request. “To our Leader, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR. The Jagaban. A man who has fought for democracy for three decades. A builder and supporter of men and women. My President, please release Nnamdi Kanu. A humble request from your son, Yul Edochie,” he wrote on Twitter. In November, 2022, actress Rita Edochie called on the Buhari-led administration to release Mr Kanu. According to the 58-year-old actress who is married to Tony, the younger brother of veteran actor Pete Edochie, the continuous detention of the IPOB leader will keep dividing Nigeria. The Edochies are not alone in calling for the release of the IPOB leader. On the 9th of June, during a visit to President Tinubu, the Governor Peter Mbah of Enugu State appealed for the release of Mr Kanu. He further stated that the South-east has made a collective demand to have Nnamdi Kanu released. British best-selling author, Journalist, Frederick Forsyth, has also advocated for the suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth of Nations over the continued detention of the IPOB leader who he described as a freedom fighter. Kanu, a dual citizen of Nigeria and the United Kingdom, has been detained by the State Security Service (SSS) over terrorism charges filed against him since he was arrested in Kenya and brought back to Nigeria in June 2021. POLL He is being prosecuted on terrorism and treasonable felony charges before Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court in Abuja.
