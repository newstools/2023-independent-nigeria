ABUJA  – The House of Representatives Ad-Hoc Committee on Media and Publicity says the House Committees would be consti­tuted very soon for a smooth take-off of the House. The Chairman of the Com­mittee, Hon Khadija Buka Ibrahim gave the indication when she briefed the House of Representatives Press Corps in Abuja. She noted that the House needed to conclude the lead­ership first before delving into the constitution of the committees. She said: “They wanted to settle the issue of the Lead­ership first which they have done and which has been done accordingly and the is­sue of the committees will fol­low and this will come before September, before the House goes on holiday. Because the leadership has been formed now, so they’ll be part and parcel of working out who will chair which committee and the constitution of those committees”. She said. She also noted, however, that it was at the discretion of the Speaker to determine who will chair which committee. On the issue of moving members to the main cham­bers of the House, Hon Ibra­him said that the 17th of July dateline stands and expressed the hope nothing will change the date. According to her, offices have already been allocated to all the lawmakers, adding that the renovation project of the permanent chamber would be concluded before the resumption of the annu­al recess. Speaking on the appoint­ment of the Principal Offi­cers, the Chairman of Ad-hoc Committee on Media and Publicity maintained that all members of the House of Representatives nominated and endorsed all the mem­bers of the body of the Prin­cipal Officers.
