Determined to end the soured relationship amongst Igbos and Yorubas in Lagos, Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State and his Lagos State counter­part, Babajide Sanwo-Olu have set up a committee to broker peace. Setting up the reconciliation committee was the highpoint of the meeting held to seek lasting solutions to the recent raging misunderstanding be­tween the Igbos residing and doing business in Lagos and their Yoruba neighbours. In a communique issued at the end of a meeting between Lagos State Government and South East Governments, it was agreed that a peace and reconciliation committee will be empanelled to “settle and douse the increasing ten­sion between the two vibrant groups.” While Sanwo-Olu endorsed for Lagos State Government, Uzodimma signed for the South East. The communique further requested the suspension of demolition at Alaba Interna­tional market with a review committee “to ensure that no building that is not in contra­vention is demolished.” It was also agreed that com­pensation will be paid for any wrong demolition in Alaba International market, while taxes, rates and demand notice levied on Igbo real estate devel­opers will be reviewed to en­sure they are not outrageously prohibitive, punitive and seem­ingly targeted at them.” To ensure that such a rift does not reoccur, the commu­nique recommended the estab­lishment of “proper channels of communication and more robust engagement with or­ganised Igbo leadership in La­gos as was the case during the tenures of Governors Tinubu, Fashola and Ambode, which engendered massive Igbo sup­port for them.” The communique acknowl­edged that Igbos have nothing against President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Governor San­wo-Olu and would continue to support them.
