Governor Nasiru Idris of Kebbi State, Kauran Gwandu, has relieved his Special Adviser on Youths, of his appointment. The sacking of the S.A. was a sequel to an indecent posting he made on his WhatsApp status. The Governor, who was enraged by the obnoxious development said the Aide trampled on the moral and social ethos of the Kebbi society, which is largely Islamic. The Kauran Gwandu vowed that his administration would not condone any of such acts that denigrate the morality and integrity of the people of the state. The Governor also cautioned other public officers against making such heinous postings in their social media handles and other public fora. According to the chief press secretary to the governor Ahmed Idris who issued the press statement said Dr Idris is a custodian of moral conduct and, therefore, would not habour men of questionable character that would dent the hard-earned image of his government. Idris added that the governor will continue to identify with good people from all walks of life who can add value and project his government in good light. Recall that the sacked aid one Babangida Sarki allegedly posted an indecent sodomy video on his WhatsApp status generating widespread condemnation from social media space which caught the attention of the government leading to his subsequent sack to serve as a deterrent to others.
