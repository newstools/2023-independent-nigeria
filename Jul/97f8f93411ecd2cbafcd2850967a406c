Nollywood actor cum politician, Tonto Dikeh is rooting for her embattled industry colleague, Davido who is in the middle of several pregnancy scandals. During the week, Anita Brown, an American business woman announced that Davido had gotten her pregnant, with proof of their relationship. Since then, the Afrobeats singer has been receiving flak from his fans and followers. Reacting to the issue, Dikeh said that there are people who can do no wrong in her eyes, citing Davido as one of them. She wrote; “There are people who can do no wrong in your eyes. And you are one of them. Love and light My Gee @davido. Wish you both strength @thechefchi. You gat something to say, say them in them blogs, this is mine. And I’m sticking with him and that’s on IJN.” Last Wednesday, Brown, in a series of posts on her Instagram status, she revealed that she is not speaking up for clout as she has never needed it. She further revealed that they met in Dubai in 2017 and what they had was not a one off affair. In a video clip, Ms Brown said that she had no idea that Davido was married. “I did not know he was married, on God. Go to his page, does it look like he is married? I’m confused. Rest in peace to the child. People knew he had a baby but nobody knew he was married. “I’m in America. Nobody knew. I wasn’t checking for it because I’m not looking to get married. I’m not looking for that right now. I wasnt searching for. I wasn’t digging and then I found out after the fact that I’m pregnant,” she said POLL She further revealed that she is not out here trying to allegedly mess up somebody’s marriage that was already messed up.
