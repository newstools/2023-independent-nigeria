The Federal Government, in a bid to improve national productivity as means of increasing total national wealth and responding to the lingering low level of productivity in most sectors of the economy, will continue to enforce implementation of established institutional and legal frameworks to anchor policies and programmes targeted at embedding productivity consciousness in society. Kachollom Daju,the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, made this known at the 2023 Meeting of the National Council on Productivity, which held from 5th – 6th of July at Radisson Hotel, Ikeja, Lagos. Daju stressed that Federal Government was prioritizing enhancement of national productivity as low productivity in most sectors of the nation had become a clog in the wheel to realising the objectives of the nation’s developmental goals and aspirations whilst lamenting that the manufacturing sector had taken a beating which was evident in foreign exchange earnings, limited number of jobs created and an import bill that can hardly be sustained by current earnings, further explaining that Nigeria’s GDP growth averaged 1.1 percent in the last seven years according to the National Bureau of Statistics report of 2021, causing unemployment and underemployment rates to increase while forcing at least 133 million Nigerians into poverty. “According to the National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria’s GDP growth averaged 1.1 percent in the last seven years, between 2015-2021, even as the country experienced two recessions. This caused unemployment and underemployment rates to increase to an all-time high of 56.1 percent in 2020, pushing at least 133 million Nigerians into multidimensional poverty” she said. She stated that government’s efforts in tackling low productivity include the establishment of a legal framework to drive relevant policies and programmes. Daju disclosed that the ministry, through its Productivity Measurement and Labour Standards (PMLS) Department, in collaboration with the National Productivity Centre, was at the forefront of the Federal Government’s intervention, by monitoring trends, conducting surveys, and continuous strategic implementation of initiatives aimed at improving Nigeria’s global productivity ranking. “The National Council on Productivity is one of the structures provided for in the National Policy on Productivity along with the state council on Productivity and Local Government Committees to give full effect to the implementation of the policy. “The inauguration of this Council in January, 2022 is evidence of government’s recognition of the role of productivity improvement and unflinching commitment towards mainstreaming productivity consciousness into the national plan”, she said.
