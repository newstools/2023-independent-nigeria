The proposed trial of Afrobeat Musician, Seun Kuti over the assault of a police officer has further been adjourned till September 27, 2023, for the continuation of the proceeding. The adjournment which was pronounced by the registrar Yaba Magistrates’s court, Mr Babalola was due to the absence of the court’s Chief Magistrate Adeola Olatunbosun. Magistrate Olatunbosun was said to have resumed her administrative leave and was thus absent in court today. It could be recalled that the Lagos State Police Command arraigned the Afrobeat musician, on May 16, 2023. The defendant was charged with assault on a police officer, an offence contrary to Section 356 of the Nigerian Criminal Code Act. Meanwhile, on May 24, Magistrate Olatunbosun in her ruling stated that the police cannot be the complainant and also the prosecutor of the case.She, therefore requested the DPP’s advice to continue the prosecution. “I need the advice of the DPP to know whether he should be prosecuted or not,” she said. She thus adjourned the case till July 3, 2023, for the DPP’s advice
