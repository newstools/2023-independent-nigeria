Dr Prince Ezeonye Obed, the Convener of DDGEI, an online inspirational media organisation, disclosed that Senator Sani, the keynote speaker, would address many of the issues affecting the nation and perhaps make some recommendations in his public lecture in line with this year’s theme, ‘Holistic Approach Towards Nation’s Rebirth’.

On this year’s award, Dr Obed said, “The purpose of the award is to recognise men and women who have excelled in their fields of endeavor and have impacted the lives of people and honour them. “It is part of the aims and objectives of the organisation to promote excellence among deserving members of the public globally. “The criteria for the choice are integrity and hard work. Once we get the recommendation, we verify and then honour.” He continued, “It is part of the dream of DDGEI to advocate and look at the way of visionary leadership in Africa. We, therefore, look for seasoned and well-informed leaders to address the trend. In the past editions, notable Nigerians like Prof Pat Utomi and Prof Anya O.
