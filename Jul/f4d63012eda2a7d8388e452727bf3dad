ABUJA  – The Executive Secretary of the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA), Engr. Shehu Ahmad Hadi, has said that the administration would take stiffer measures to save lives and prop­erty in TradeMore Estate. This is as he said that Trade­more Estate did not have FCDA approved building plan and that the continued flooded areas can best be left as green areas and not residential. Hadi who is also the Chair­man , Special Ministerial Task Team on flood mitigation, made this known when he appeared as a guest on Channels Television Flagship programme, dateline Abuja over the weekend. He said most structures were preventing water from flowing freely through its natural course which is responsible for flooding recorded in some parts of the city. “Buildings in Trademore had been severally marked for demo­lition. Warnings have been given year in year out. They just keep risking their lives and that of oth­ers “People are clamouring that we act quickly and take tough de­cisions to save lives and property. And this is what we must do. We cannot act as though we don’t see this man-made problem caused by those who violated the Abuja Master plan.” While adding that the area is on a low line zone which is not safe, he said flooding can come at any time. “They know this and have been experiencing it over the years; we have told the residents there to vacate. “The Police station in Trade­more would be demolished. It would go alongside other build­ings too we have engaged the FCT Police command and the Force Headquarters and we pro­vided a suitable place for them to operate from and fight crime. “The property that was sub­merged in Trademore include market the Police station and oth­er structures. If we had not taken proactive measures to relocate the police station, you can see that it was part of the reference point. We were able to do that because it’s a government prop­erty; severally, we have marked the structures and given notices for evacuation to no avail.”
