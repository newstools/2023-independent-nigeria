BAUCHI  – A 32-year-old man known as Auwal Usman has been sentenced to two years in the correctional centre by a Bauchi State Chief Magistrate Court number 12 for cutting the hand of his friend with a machete. The Prosecutor Inspector, Yusuf Musa, earlier told the court that the suspect, Awwal Usman of Dogon Ruwa village Ari in Ningi Local Government Area of Bauchi State had a misunderstanding with Sabo Abduwa, his friend. He said that the misunder­standing between them resulted in a physical fight, which made Aww­al bring out a machete and hit his friend on his hands. Yusuf said that the impact of the cut made one of the hands to fall down while the remaining one was dangling. The Police prosecutor said that Abduwa was taken to General Hos­pital Ningi where the remaining hand was amputated, adding that the hospital battled to save his life because of the injuries he sustained as a result of the deep cut, contrary to section 241 of the penal code. The suspect admitted that he was guilty of the charges levelled against him and plead for lenien­cy from the court being the first offender. While delivering judgement on the matter, the presiding Chief Magistrate, Haruna Abdulmumini Mamman, said that the court was convinced that the victim lost his two hands as a result of the heinous act of the suspect Awwal, which rendered the victim incapacitated. Mamman sentenced the sus­pect to two years in correctional service without an option of fine for causing grievous hurt to the victim contrary to Section 241 of the penal code and ordered him to pay the sum of 150,000 medical expenses spent by the victim.
