A Police Inspector identified as Samuel Ukpabio has been dismissed from the police force for alleged baby theft. The Lagos State Police Command has confirmed hisdismissal in a statement shared on verified Twitter handle of the commandâ€™s spokesperson, SP Benjamin Hundeyin. Hundeyin said the dismissal was approved on Thursday to pave the way for his prosecution. He said the State Commissioner of Police, CP Idowu Owohunwa, reiterated his unwavering determination to police Lagos within the dictates of rule of law, civility and respect for human life. Recall that a 35-year-old woman identified as Fortune Obhafuoso, had accused Ukpabio, who was attached to Panti Division, of conniving with others to steal her day-old baby. The single mother of three explained that Ukpabio arrested her and accused her of attempting to sell the baby for N3m and forced her to write a statement to that effect. Obhafuoso claimed that Ukpabio forcefully took away her new born baby and gave him to an unidentified woman a day after she gave birth. She said Ukpabio gave her N185,000 and threatened her never to return for the child or he will arrest her and take the remaining two children from her. POLL She eventually reported the incident to a rights activist, Dr Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, who petitioned security agents to wade into the issue.
