AKURE  – A visually challenged man, Ka­reem Babatunde, is currently undergoing serious medical challenge as he drinks two bucketful of water every day to flush out unwanted fluid from his system. According to a statement by the spokesman of the Nigeria Association of The Blind, Ol­adele Nasirudeen, the patient needs N1 million to undergo surgery in less than a month to save his life. He explained that Baba­tunde’s situation would get wors­ened if he failed to undergo the operation soon. Nasirudeen disclosed that the patient had early undergone sur­gery, but he needed the second to keep him alive. He, therefore, appealed to philanthropists, well-meaning people and the Ondo State gov­ernment to come to the rescue of the patient by donating N1 mil­lion to him through his Union Bank Account No: 0111176420, Account Name: Kareem BB. The statement reads in parts: “Our brother, Kareem Baba­tunde, must finish drinking wa­ter in this bucket twice daily so that he will have enough water in his system to flush out some unwanted fluids so that it won’t aggravate his pain. “Even at night, he must wake up to drink, else he will be in pain. Let’s remember him in our deepest prayers for helpers to raise the money for the sur­gery as soon as possible. “He has just less than one month before the situation gets worsened. We are with you Kareem. He needs to go for his second operation as soon as pos­sible. So, we are calling on Nige­rians to please assist. We really appreciate.
