ABUJA – Owing to growing demands for verification or confirmation of result slips, the National Examinations Council, NECO, has launched a unified portal where candidates can easily verify their results online, without having to travel to the Commission. The new portal code-named NECO e-Verify is an online concept bringing result verification solution that guarantees instant authentication of academic and basic information about prospective candidates for admission and employment into academic institutions and works. Speaking at the launch of the portal in Abuja, NECO Registrar, Prof. Dantani Wushishi, explained that the introduction of the NECO e-Verify was due to the growing need for verification and confirmation of results by institutions both home and abroad. He noted that before now, all requests for verification and confirmation of results were routed through the Council’s headquarters in Minna, “which took a longer time to process.” According to him, result verification is an important process that helps to ensure the accuracy of academic credentials. “Due to the growing need for verification and confirmation of results by institutions both home and abroad, the Council decided that now was the best time to introduce the e-Verify platform. “From available records at our disposal, we have observed that there were requests for verification and confirmation of results from 64 institutions across 37 countries over a two-year period (2020-2022). “Similarly, we have such requests from 72 institutions in Nigeria within the same period-this is besides requests from individuals which are numerous,”he said.
