Akeredolu was expecting to resume office on Thursday, July 6, 2023, having applied for medical leave on June 5, 2023, but he didn’t resume. On Monday, the Speaker, Ondo State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Olamide Oladiji informed the House that he received a letter from the governor seeking extension on his medical leave. The letter signed by the speaker, entitled: “ODHA Receives Letter Of Extension On Medical Leave From Governor Akeredolu,” reads inter alia: “Following Doctor’s advice on the need to take adequate rest after recuperating, Ondo State Governor, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Odunayo Akeredolu SAN, CON, has forwarded the letter of extension on medical leave to the Ondo State House of Assembly. “Receiving the letter on behalf of other Lawmakers, the Governor’s action is in line with section 190 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended). “According to the letter, his Deputy, Hon . Lucky Aiyedatiwa would continue to act as Governor until there is a written declaration to the contrary.” That his deputy would “continue to act as Governor until there is a written declaration to the contrary” makes the extension of the medical leave indefinite.
