…..Secure Maximum Points in Promotion Battle Four-time Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) Champions, Kano Pillars boosted their chances of an immediate return to the top flight after they defeated EFCC Football Club, 1-0, at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba during the ongoing Nigeria National League (NNL) Super 8 competition. Sai Masu Gida, as they are fondly called by followers, were relegated last July, as they finished the 2021/22 season in 19thplace. The first half which was played under heavy downpour against the Eagle Boys, ended in a stalemate, before Williams from Pillars scored the only goal of the encounter after the interval, to pick maximum points. In the second match of the day, Katsina United beat DMD Football Club, 2-1 to also boost their promotion chances. Victor Mboama bagged a quick-fire brace within 20 minutes of the start, as Katsina United came out firing on all cylinders. The first half did finish with Katsina United unable to add to their tally. The second half was a tepid affair, with intermittent rainfall, disrupting the tempo, however, it was DMD who halved the deficit from the spot, following a handball in the KatsinaUnited penalty box in the dying minutes of the game. Katsina United head coach Usman Sharif’s Abd’Allah gave kudos to his boys for the victory, as he reiterated that their target was an instant promotion to the Professional League. He also promised that his team would perform better against their next opponents, as they were trying to adjust to playing on the grass as opposed to the synthetic surfaces that they were used to. Katsina United will lock horns with EFCC FC, while Kano Pillars face DMD FC in the next round of fixtures.
