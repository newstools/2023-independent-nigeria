Last week, The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) issued an alert warning of the high probability of 14 states experienc­ing heavy rainfall that might lead to flooding. This is not the first time NEMA and Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency (NHSA), through its Annual Flood Outlook (AFO), will issue such alerts, but we keep losing lives and properties to flooding de­spite early warnings. Our approach and response to such signals have remained reactive. The same last week, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) an­nounced an outbreak of diphtheria in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). NCDC further informed us that there have been multiple disease outbreaks, including diphtheria, since Decem­ber 2022, with 33 LGAs in eight states affected. Meanwhile, diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease, but our leaders and institutions would prefer to be reactive. The problem is not peculiar to NEMA, NHSA, NCDC, the affected states or the likely victims. There is a systemic challenge of our institu­tions and leaders preferring reactive instead of proactive responses to so­cio-economic challenges. This is from the highest level of government to the least of our public institutions. We are permanently reactive in our approach to governance, suffering devastating consequences before be­latedly putting on our thinking caps. Reactive governance refers to a mode of governance that primarily responds to immediate and pressing issues that arise without sufficient long-term planning or proactive measures. This anomaly is the pre­dominant habit of governance in our country. We tend to sit and wait for foreseeable disasters to consume us before responding. Most of what we treat as emergencies do not qual­ify. They are avoidable incidents that should not catch any responsible gov­ernment by surprise. The source of our reactive ap­proach is a tradition of governance. We emphasise ‘acting’ over and above ‘thinking’ through problems on a long-term basis. Issues like flood disaster prediction, epidemic prevention, speculative vaccine production, and power outage prevention are all ways of avoiding disasters that are sure to occur. This reactive approach to so­cio-economic challenges falls with­in the “reactive state “concept. Two essential characteristics of the reac­tive state are: first, institutions fail to undertake initiatives to prevent the occurrence of an undesirable event though it has the power and incentive to do so; second, such institutions re­spond to pressure for change in an erratic and unsystematic manner. In Nigeria, this reactive state ap­proach naturally flows because it benefits operatives of the system, and our urgency index is high. Man­ifestations of this reactive state can be seen in our policy approaches to Boko Haram, banditry, kidnapping, oil theft in the Niger Delta and other security incidents. Further instances demonstrate these cultural-cum-historical reactive approaches to national problems than a proactive and systematic long-term approach seen in the most developed worlds. Nigeria has faced various security challenges, including ter­rorism, insurgency, and communal clashes. In some instances, the gov­ernment’s response has been primar­ily reactive, with the deployment of security forces after attacks have occurred rather than proactively ad­dressing the root causes of these is­sues through intelligence gathering, preventive measures, and communi­ty engagement. Nigeria’s infrastructure, includ­ing roads, power supply, and public transportation, has been a subject of concern for many years. Often, the government has taken a reactive ap­proach to address these deficiencies by initiating projects and repairs in response to public outcry or when critical failures occur rather than proactively investing in infrastruc­ture development and maintenance. POLL Nigeria’s economy has traditional­ly been heavily reliant on oil exports, making it susceptible to fluctuations in global oil prices. Reactive gover­nance is evident in the government’s response to oil price shocks, which often involves scrambling to adjust the budget, implement austerity measures, or seek external loans to address revenue shortfalls instead of proactively diversifying the economy and reducing dependence on oil. Besides, Nigeria faces challenges in its education sector, including inad­equate infrastructure, outdated cur­ricula, and low educational outcomes. The government’s approach has often been reactive, responding to issues as they arise rather than proactively in­vesting in education reforms, teacher training, curriculum development, and infrastructure improvements to ensure quality education for all. Corruption has been a persistent issue in Nigeria, affecting various sectors and hindering development. Reactive governance is evident in the government’s response to corruption scandals, which often involves inves­tigations, prosecutions, and public outcry after the fact, rather than implementing proactive measures to prevent corruption, strengthen anti-corruption institutions, and pro­mote transparency and accountability. In the developed world, there is a great emphasis on thought in gover­nance. This is why Washington is full of think tanks whose only business is to think through and develop long-term solutions to possible national problems. Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) sometimes collaborate actively with universities and research institutes to work out long-term solutions in anticipation. In most of Europe and Asia, government departments have research departments staffed by some of the best brains trained to conduct anticipatory research and study dif­ferent problems in relevant areas. The best approach has proven to be leaders and institutions that adopt proactive decision-making. It is cheaper to be proactive than to be reactive. Being proactive saves lives. By its futuristic estimation, China knows that Africa is the future mar­ket; hence, it invests heavily in teach­ing Africans the Chinese language. Being reactive often comes with disastrous consequences. One signif­icant adverse result of reactive gov­ernance is the populace’s permanent sense of uncertainty. People are un­sure that what may come next will not consume them. A sense of collective vulnerability weakens people’s trust in government. People are left with a sense of self-help, of everyone to themselves. In cases of natural disas­ter, recourse to superstition becomes the only and last resort. People must choose between trust in government and belief in divine salvation. Proph­ecies of doom acquire legitimacy and find a ready market. When governance is not informed by rational and scientific projection, the future becomes a dark zone of uncertainty and the abode of the un­known. Fear and cynicism take hold of the hearts of citizens. A major reason why we are so reactive is that we need to have re­spect for science and data. Data-driv­en policies enable policymakers to identify trends, anticipate problems, and develop targeted interventions before they escalate into crises. Ni­geria must prioritise sustainable development practices that balance economic growth with environmen­tal and social considerations. This in­cludes promoting renewable energy, implementing sound environmental policies, and adopting responsible resource management practices. A proactive approach to sustainabili­ty can help mitigate environmental degradation, address climate change challenges, and promote social equity. To move beyond reactive gover­nance in Nigeria, adopting a proactive approach that focuses on long-term planning, anticipates challenges, and promotes sustainable development is important. Some key areas that could contribute to this shift are de­tailed below. The Nigerian government should emphasise the formulation and im­plementation of long-term strategic plans. This involves setting clear goals, identifying potential risks and opportunities, and developing strate­gies to address them. Strategic plan­ning enables proactive decision-mak­ing and reduces the need for reactive measures. It is crucial to strengthen the insti­tutions responsible for governance in Nigeria, including the judiciary, legis­lature, and civil service. This involves enhancing their human and institu­tional capacity, improving transpar­ency and accountability, and reduc­ing political interference. Strong institutions are better equipped to anticipate and address issues before crises occur. In addition, active citizen par­ticipation is vital for effective gov­ernance. Governments should pro­mote transparency, engage citizens in decision-making processes, and establish mechanisms for feedback and accountability. This helps iden­tify problems early on, encourages citizen ownership, and fosters a sense of responsibility among the populace. Furthermore, proactive gover­nance relies on accurate and timely information. Governments should invest in data collection, analysis, and utilisation to inform decision-making processes. Departments of Research and Planning cannot be a dumping ground or a place of punishment for public servants that have fallen out of favour. It should rather be the hub of policy making and designing solutions to challenges. Let the best brains man this critical department. We should collaborate with our re­search institutions where there are obvious capacity gaps. Our leaders and managers of in­stitutions always want to profit from disasters. Even at the policy level, the equation often favours a reactive approach rather than a proactive ap­proach. With newly elected officials at all levels, we need to switch from reactive to proactive ways of dealing with issues of national and global importance. It is important to note that while these examples used above highlight instances of reactive governance, they do not encompass the entirety of governance in Nigeria. Nigeria has also witnessed proactive initia­tives and policies in various areas, but there is room for further im­provement in adopting a proactive approach to governance to address long-term challenges effectively. Moving beyond reactive gover­nance in Nigeria requires a shift in mindset, focusing on critical thinking over “doing”, long-term planning, and strengthening institutions and citizen engagement. By adopting a proactive approach, Nigeria can better antic­ipate and address challenges, pro­mote sustainable development, and improve the well-being of its citizens. This new administration is poised to do great things, and its starting point should be to prioritise the shift from the dominant leadership mentality of reactive governance to a proactive one. The administra­tion must be intentional and proac­tive in solving Nigeria’s myriads of problems and rely on evidence and scientific approaches rather than the traditional path dependency that has characterised our governance in the past. The lack of ability to solve major issues in Nigeria is not often because of a lack of resources but because of a lack of proactively planning and adopting creative and innovative solu­tions. Our leaders must adopt new ap­proaches to doing things if they must succeed. Remember that you cannot do the same thing and expect a differ­ent result. Input determines output – garbage in, garbage out is the com­puter language. That is true about input and output in problem-solving.
