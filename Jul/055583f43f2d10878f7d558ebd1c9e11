Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, Tues­day paid glowing tributes to the first civilian gov­ernor of Rivers State, the late Senator Melford Okilo, describing him as a nation­alist who moulded him po­litically. Speaking during the 15th memorial celebration of Chief Okilo, who he eulogised as a political sage and vision­ary leader, Governor Diri stated that the late politician was his role model whom he studied closely. Diri said Okilo had a huge impact on his life and political career. His Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Daniel Alabrah, quoted him as saying that during his early days in politics, he ran for office under Okilo’s party, National Solidarity Move­ment (NSM). According to the governor, he followed in the footsteps of Okilo, got involved in Ijaw activism and was exposed to the injustices he always com­plained about and sought to change. He hailed Okilo as a leader that placed the interest of the people above personal con­siderations, stressing that his track record was respon­sible for his celebration even in death. Diri urged the political class to emulate the late Riv­ers governor and shun the culture of violence just to oc­cupy political office. He also stated that he late politician should be cele­brated as a nationalist and called on his Rivers State counterpart to join Bayelsa in the Okilo remembrance celebration. POLL He declared that going for­ward, the event will not be left for the people of Ogbia alone but will be a state event. Diri while recounting the ideals of Okilo, called on President Bola Tinubu to re­structure Nigeria to address some of the injustices which he (Tinubu) also suffered.
