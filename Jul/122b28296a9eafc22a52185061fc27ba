ENUGU – There was pandemonium in Enugu metropolis on Wednes­day as gunshots rented the air following an alleged attack by hoodlums enforcing sit-at-home order. Our correspondents re­ported that Enugu residents trooped out in large numbers for their daily business on Wednesday morning but an attack by gunmen forced them to run back home for safety. Shootings were reported in some parts of the metropolises which include Abakpa, Agba­ni Road, Old Park, and Emene. Commercial and business areas including schools that earlier opened were forced to close as some parents rushed to schools to carry their chil­dren back home. An eyewitness account, Be­atrice Nnaji who encountered the gunmen along Agbani Road said, “I was on my way to Mayor Market at Agbani Road when I saw some boys who wore masks inside tricy­cle and shooting sporadically. “We all ran out from the bus to hide inside the gutter; I even got wound on my left leg while jumping inside the gut­ter. Thank God I’m safe. Also, Peace Ugwuanyi, a Corps member told our corre­spondent that she went to the Enugu North LG Secretariat for her clearance when they started hearing gunshots. “We were inside the secre­tariat when we saw people run­ning helter-skelter as a result of gunshots; we ran inside the office and locked ourselves up. POLL “The situation is calm now as Security operatives are al­ready in the area but the situ­ation was terrible today,” she said. As of the time of filling this report, security operatives with armoured personnel carriers were seen in strategic areas while the helicopter was hovering over the city.
