Elon Musk, the billionaire found­er of Tesla Inc., says a temporary limit has been made to the num­ber of posts users can read daily on Twitter. The move seeks to tackle is­sues around “data and systems manipulation”, Musk, the chief technology officer (CTO) and chairman of the firm, said in a tweet on Saturday. He said verified users will have access to 6,000 posts daily, while unverified and new users will be allowed to read 600 and 300 posts, respectively. But Musk did not disclose when the temporary restrictions would commence nor for how long they would last. To address extreme levels of data scraping & system manipu­lation, we’ve applied the follow­ing temporary limits: – Verified accounts are limit­ed to reading 6000 posts/day – Unverified accounts to 600 posts/day – New unverified accounts to 300/day POLL — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 1, 2023. “To address extreme levels of data scraping and system ma­nipulation, we’ve applied the fol­lowing temporary limits,” Musk tweeted. “Verified accounts are limit­ed to reading 6,000 posts per day. Unverified accounts to 600 posts per day. New unverified accounts to 300 per day.” In a related tweet, the billion­aire added that limits to users’ readership would be increased subsequently by about 33 per­cent. “Rate limits increasing soon to 8,000 for verified, 800 for unver­ified, and 400 for new unverified,” Musk added. Since Musk took over the mi­croblogging platform, Twitter has introduced several features and changes. In 2022, the firm came up with a subscription package for the verified blue tick mark.
