George Agbakahi, South- East LeaerTinubu Sup­port Group and member All Progressives Congress (APC), Presidential Cam­paign Council has said that President Bola Tinubu will release Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) at the appropriate time. Agbakahi who spoke in an interview on Tuesday said that Nnamdi Kanu’s case is a global issue, and that Tinu­bu is a compassionate leader and would be ready to release Kanu even if it is with some sort of conditions. He said, “The issue of Nnamdi Kanu is a global issue and the President discussed this issue when he campaigned in Ebonyi State. “As a member of the Pres­idential Campaign Council, from the South-East I was privileged to be in that cam­paign rally. The President said openly that he would work with Igbo leaders to deal with issues that are affecting Ndigbo, especially the issue of Nnamdi Kanu and the IPOB as well as the issue of Unknown Gunmen. I believe that the President will do that at the right time. “In my opinion, I believe at some point, based on the current political develop­ment in the country at some point, Nnamdi Kanu may be released even if it is under some conditions. Because if you see what is going on in the South-East, it is very terrible. I can tell you that currently in the South-East, the issues of Unknown Gun­men, sit-at-home order, every Monday have affected com­merce tremendously. People in the South-East are living in fear. I believe that the pres­ident at the appropriate time will consider all these issues holistically and do the right thing. On the issue of appoint­ments for Ndigbo, he said, “It is common knowledge that our President is a seasoned politician. He has politics in his genes. He is a father figure who recognizes the abilities of all the geo-politi­cal zones of this country. He has never been discrimina­tory either in his previous position as governor of La­gos State.
