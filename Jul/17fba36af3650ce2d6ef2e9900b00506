The First Lady of Lagos, Dr. Claudiana Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, on Thursday, called on Christians from all denominations to embrace peace and unity for the progress and development of Nigeria. The governor’s wife gave the charge at the 2023 Lagos Praise 3.0, an annual event organized by the Office of the First Lady, Lagos, to create a viable platform for the state’s first family, graceful ladies, and members of the Committee of Wives of Lagos State Officials (COWLSO) to come together in collaboration with the five blocs of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Lagos State Chapter. In her address, Sanwo-Olu said this year’s theme: “Casting Crowns,” taken from Rev 4: 10-11. was chosen specifically to signify the act of laying down one’s crown and submitting to worship, which is the essence of the gathering. Dr. Sanwo-Olu urged all Christians, particularly in the five blocs of CAN, to use the platform to worship God in holiness, saying that the body of Christ is one. She said: “I, therefore, heartily welcome you all to this intense praise session and urge you to enjoy the presence of God and be alive in the spirit to get the best from this worship service. “Beyond this service, I admonish us in the light of Hebrews 12: 14 that we should follow peace with all men and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.“Let’s embrace peace and be pure in our relationship with people.”
