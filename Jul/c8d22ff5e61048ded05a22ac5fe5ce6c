The Chairman of the Youth Wing of the Urhobo Christian Ministers Association, Pastor Tareri Avwomakpa Esq., has congratulated the Governor of Delta State, Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori on his recent electoral victory at the Supreme Court. It could be recalled that the Supreme Court had on Friday 6th July, 2023, dismissed an appeal brought before it by Chief Ikie Aghwarianovwe, seeking the disqualification of the Delta State Governor, Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori for lacking in merit. The apex court in a unanimous judgement, delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim, held that the appellant failed to prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt. Avwomakpa, a member of Sheriffied Lawyers in a congratulatory message, stated that the declaration by the supreme court goes to show that we cannot rely on a change of name by a candidate to rob him of the mandate freely given to him by the majority of Deltans. According to the message, “the Supreme Court cannot be used for such mandate robbery. Following my personal interaction with the Governor during the visit of our team of experts, and our examination of relevant documents prior to the elections, I concluded without doubt that nobody can capitalize on the situation to defeat him in a court of law. “All his records are intact and properly within the contemplation of law. No element of fraud whatsoever and his case can not go the way of false documents presentation by Biobarakumo Degi-Eremieyor of Bayelsa State to INEC at the Supreme Court. “I congratulate the Governor and I urge all those who are still in tribunals/courts over the 2023 elections to redirect their resources and energy towards improving the lives of our people. Today it is the turn of Elder Sheriff O. Oborevwori by providence and it could be your turn tomorrow”, it added.
