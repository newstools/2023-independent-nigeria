A few days ago, it was reported that Dybala had been added to Chelsea’s wish list as newly appointed manager Mauricio Pochettino is a huge admirer of the Argentine attacker. Dybala joined Roma last summer on a free transfer and has a release clause of €12 million for non-Italian clubs. Amid regular links to CFC, the World Cup 2022 winner has finally spoken about his desire and his future. Nicolas Jackson and Christopher Nkunku have already arrived at Chelsea but Pochettino has indicated that there could be more signings to reinforce the attack. The rumours of a move have fuelled since Dybala’s appearances in England as he attended the Wimbeldon and the Formula One British Grand Prix. This would be a huge blow for Chelsea as the player himself has made his intentions clear. He insists that he is happy at Roma and not looking to leave. CFC defender Thiago Silva had spoken about Chelsea and made his feelings known that he would be very happy if the 29 year old joined the Blues. Now, Dybala wont be a like for like replacement for Mount. The Argentine is capable of playing behind the striker as well as on the right flank, where he drifts inward playing just off the striker or as an interior. Dybala is certainly a player that can add a lot to Chelsea’s attack but as things stand it is a full stop from player’s side.
