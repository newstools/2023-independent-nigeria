Liverpool left-back Luke Chambers, 19, is wanted on loan by Bayer Leverkusen. The youngster is highly-rated at Anfield but still a way away from the first team and is likely to leave on loan again this season after spending last season with Kilmarnock in Scotland. Chambers joined Liverpool’s academy when he was six years old and has worked his way through the ranks, signing his latest contract with the club in May. He has received praise from the likes of Reds defender Kostas Tsimikas and assistant manager Pep Lijnders in recent years, with the former saying: ‘This kid impresses me a lot. He’s a very, very good player and always very focused in the training. For me, my personal advice for him is to never stop dreaming and never stop working hard.’ The defender has been capped at several youth levels by England, and was part of the squad that won the U19 European Championships in 2022. Several other sides are interested in his services too, though Leverkusen are keen to strengthen at left-back and have identified Chambers as their main target. Chambers made 16 appearances while on loan in Scotland last season and received high praise from manager Derek McInnes following his debut. Though he’s yet to make a senior appearance for Liverpool, he has been involved in matchday squads and is rated highly by Jurgen Klopp. POLL It’s possible he will spend pre-season with the Reds before his immediate future is decided.
