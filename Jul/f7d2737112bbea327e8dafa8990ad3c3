Paris Saint-Germain are delighted to announce the signing of Marco Asensio. The Spanish forward joins the Parisian club on a three-year deal through to June 2026. After coming through the RCD Mallorca youth academy, Marco Asensio made his first-team debut with his hometown club during the 2013/14 season. After joining Real Madrid in summer 2015, he was immediately loaned out to RCD Espanyol where he scored four times in 37 appearances, including a brace and an assist on his debut for the Catalan club. Marco Asensio then returned to Madrid where, over seven seasons, he won three La Liga titles (2017, 2020, 2022), 2 Spanish Super Cups (2017 & 2020), 3 Champions Leagues (2017, 2018, 2022), 4 Club World Cups (2016, 2017, 2018 and 2022), 3 UEFA Super Cups (2016, 2017 and 2022) and a Copa del Rey (2023). The left-footer was called up by Spain for the first time in May 2016, and was part of Julen Lopetegui’s 2018 World Cup squad. Four years later, Marco Asensio featured in his second World Cup, scoring once. “It’s a privilege to be part of this great club,” said Marco Asensio. “I’m looking forward to joining my new teammates and working with them to achieve some great goals.” You can find Marco Asensio’s reaction to joining the club exclusively on PSG.FR and across Paris Saint-Germain’s digital platforms.
