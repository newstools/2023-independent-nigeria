Chairman of Lumiere Group International, Douglas Fordjour is encouraging Africa to embrace the the huge potentials deposited in the trade industry across the continent as he called on young and established entrepreneurs currently pervading the business space to embrace the investment opportunities staring at them. Being an experienced and successful investment professional with more than 20 decades in various fields of life, Douglas Fordjour in an interactive session with select journalist opened up about the avalanche of investment opportunities young minds in Africa and beyond can tap into by developing their capacity to serve as the link between emerging markets and investors. According to him, there are lots of projects that will spring up in the next few years as Africa has been identified as a fertile land for the rest of the world to invest, warning that if young people, especially entrepreneurs don’t rise to the occasion and develop their capacity to identify opportunities, they may miss the big moment that could transform their lives and the African region. The trailblazer in the African Commodities and Trade fiancé sector further mentioned that one must be passion-driven to transform his immediate environment and Africa at large, adding that Africa is blessed with abundant opportunities and resources that would remain untapped if those who live in the region don’t take advantage of the potentials before them. The financial expert who has worked in the UK, US and UAE, gaining valuable insights and skills in the global financial markets, said that he believes his many years in the London financial district and expertise in developing customer-centric and innovative investment and finance solutions will be of immense help to the country. Fordjour has successfully executed projects across diverse industries, including infrastructure,telecommunication, transportation and logistics, energy, oil & gas, mining and construction. He is also passionate about adapting and localizing best practices from other regions to improve the economic prospects of Africa.
