One player that the club might be eyeing a move for during that time is Liverpool defender Nat Phillips. At the end of June, Phil Hay, via The Athletic, revealed that the Whites were interested in signing the Reds defender this summer. This was said to be regardless of who the club appointed as their new head coach. Then, in a further report following Farkeâ€™s appointment, Hay doubled down on the above, and claimed that Daniel Farke had been keen on Phillips during his time in charge at Norwich City.
