LAGOS – The Ezendigbo of Ibadanland and Oyo state His Royal Highness (HRH), Eze Alex Anozie, has said that he would begin to drag to court anyone or group disobeying court judgements. Eze Anozie who made the threat in Ibadan in a release said that he had noticed that some people were refusing to obey court judgements adding that anyone or group refusing to obey court rulings or supporting anyone who is disobeying court judgements by inviting them to the occasion under the capacity of what they claim which they are not are lovers of anarchy in the society. He explained that Ndigbo in Ibadan and Oyo state are law-abiding citizens who settle any problem that cannot be settled among themselves in court noting that those still disobeying judgements should note that they are watching. The Ezendigbo appealed to those disobeying the law to ignore some lawyers and few disgruntled individuals who are deceiving them stressing that he would soon begin to enforce his rights by calling the attention of the court to their disobedience of court judgements. He posited that “We have endured enough leaving room for them to have a change of heart by desisting from doing the wrong things “ pointing out that “ those encouraging them should be ready to answer whenever they are invited to the court to state why they have become above the law.“ Dr. Anozie argued “that you have appealed against any judgement does not mean that the judgement is not effective unless you have gotten a stay of execution over that particular judgement emphasizing that “they should be bold enough to stop from deceiving them saying that we don’t want to see anybody sent to prison even for one day because we all know the damaging effect.” He observed that “we are all brothers and friends and nobody should take our patience for cowardice even though we come in peace and for peace and we can only have that peace through the rule of law, justice and equity”.
