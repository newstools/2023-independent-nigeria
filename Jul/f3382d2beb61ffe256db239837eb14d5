Engineer Ikechuwku Emetu, the deputy governor of Abia State, has called for collaboration between Umuchieze and Hausa Community resident there in order to fight and rid the place of criminal elements. Engr. Emetu who stated this during a meeting with the Umuchieze Clan Development Union and the Hausa Community on ways to ensure peaceful coexistence and putting a permanent end to series of kidnappings, killings, raping and armed robbery taking place in Umuchieze Community and the environs, said no meaningful development could take place in such atmosphere. The geputy governor while describing as criminal the signing of a memorandum of understanding by seven landlords on behalf of the community with the Hausa Community without the knowledge of the custodians of the traditional institutions, mandated the Hausa Community to forward to the state government a copy of the MOU, receipt of payments made so far as well as copies of taxes claimed to have been paid into government’s coffers, reiterating that government is determined to ensure that the right thing is done through their collective efforts. He lamented that the Governor Alex Otti-led administration having been left with backlog of liabilities from past administrations would not tolerate any form of extortion and criminality and warned that no revenue can be collected by any community without Government’s approval. Earlier in his address, president general, Umuchieze Clan Development Union, Chief Victor Ogbukwe, appealed for government’s urgent intervention on security crisis in their area, inclusion of Umuchieze in sharing of revenue, check alleged havoc perpetrated by herdsmen and criminals living in the Cattle Market through killing, kidnapping of their people and ravaging their farmlands among others. Also speaking, leader of the Hausa Community, Alhaji Yaro Danladi, who said they had never failed in their obligations to their Umuchieze host community assured that they were willing to join in the fight against insecurity and every form of criminality in their Cattle Market. Other stakeholders from the two groups further made presentations to the deputy governor on some vexing issues and the way forward.
