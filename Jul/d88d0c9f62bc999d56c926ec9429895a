The Campaign Manager of the Obi-Datti Presidential Cam­paign in the February 25, 2023, election, Mr. Oseloka H. Obaze has warned the Independent National Electoral Commis­sion, INEC against tampering with IRev as it concerns the Fed­eral Capital Territory (FCT). In a tweet on Saturday, Mr. Obaze said that intelligence reaching the Campaign office shows that INEC is trying to yield to pressure to temper with the results of some states including the FCT to enable the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to be in good standing. “According to our source, INEC is tampering with the machines used in the election to adjust FCT results to give the APC candidate, the much-need­ed 25%, which he did not get as per the initial INEC declaration and for which he is being chal­lenged at the Presidential Elec­tion Tribunal. “It’s not clear how the Elec­toral Commission can brazenly carry out such bizarre action but given the abracadabra they did to announce the APC Can­didate winner by 4 a.m., there is nothing to be taken for grant­ed,” he said. Mr. Obaze warned that INEC and the ruling APC may be tak­ing the adherence to the rule of law and due process disposition of Nigerians in general and the Obidient Movement in partic­ular for granted, but that it would be courting catastrophe for them to want to pour salt into an open wound inflicted on Nigeria’s electorate. The former United Nations, UN diplomat reminded INEC that what they are trying to do is tantamount to raising a dead horse and that whether the reports were fake or real, the Commission should know the level of public confidence in them has long been eroded.
