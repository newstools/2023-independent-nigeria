The member representing Ughelli South Constituency in the Delta State House of Assembly, Hon. Festus Utuama has congratulated the Governor of the state, Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori, on his victory at the Supreme Court on Friday. He said that the verdict of the apex court was a welcomed development and victory for the nation’s democracy and a reaffirmation that Oborevwori was eminently qualified to be the Governor of Delta State. “I must commend the courage and sagacity exhibited by the panel of justices of the Supreme Court that dismissed an appeal brought before it by Chief Ikie Aghwarianovwe, seeking the disqualification of the Delta State Governor, Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori for lacking in merit. “On behalf of my family, constituents of Ughelli South Local Government Area, I congratulate my dear Governor, Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori on this victory. “The case was a needless distraction because the apex court held that the appellant failed to prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt. “This victory is for Deltans, and I urge all those who are still in court against our dear Governor to sheathe their swords and work for the interest of the people of the state,” he said.
