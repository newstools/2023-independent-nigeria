ABUJA – Senator Sadiku Ohere (APC Kogi Central), has hinted on legislation that would make the executive intensify efforts to complete the Ajaokuta Steel Project. This he said will also serve as a panacea for incessant building collapse in Nigeria. Ohere at an interactive session with journalists at the Senate in Abuja, said the completion of the steel project would provide builders with quality and affordable iron and steel for all categories of buildings. According to him, the problem of building collapse in Nigeria largely arose from the unaffordability of quality materials by many of the builders who, according to him, resorted to cutting corners with the attendant tragedy of structure collapse. This is as he explained that the steel project would also serve as a catalyst for industrialization of the country if completed and made to operate optimally. Read him, “Ajaokuta Steel Project needs federal attention and I believe that before President Bola Tinubu clocks 100 days in office he will give the required attention for its completion. “Already 38 out of the 46 production units of the project have been completed, remaining just eight units. “It is a worthy project that will facilitate the development of the country across the various sectors and most importantly, serve as a panacea for the incessant problem of building collapse in the country through production of quality and affordable iron and steel builders and construction firms. POLL “Completion of Ajaokuta will also facilitate the industrialization of the country as well as solve the problem of epileptic power supply with electricity generation from its already completed Thermal Plant,” he said. He also called on President Tinubu to revisit the dredging of Rivers Niger and Benue started by the late President Umoru Musa Yar’ Adua in 2008 but later abandoned. He further tasked the federal government on dredging the Niger, insisting that it will help to stop the problem of flooding in Lokoja, Kogi State.
