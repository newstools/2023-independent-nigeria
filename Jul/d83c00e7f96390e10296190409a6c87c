LOKOJA – Ahead of Tuesday’s election of the Senate Minority leader, the foremost aspirants, Senator Aminu Tambuwal, Seriake Dickson and other aggrieved members of PDP on Monday afternoon stormed the National Secretariat of the party demanding the letter of the anointment of her candidate for the position of Minority leader to the National Assembly. The PDP lawmakers, however, met stiff resistance at the secretariat gate, where stern-looking guards directed them to instead of coming to the secretariat, they work hard to garner the votes of other senators on the floor of the Hallow Chamber. The senators were disturbed by the action of the Party leadership who insisted that the order of the House, mandated candidates to campaign to other members of the Assembly to secure their vote on the floor of the House and not to come to the Secretariat for anointment. Speaking with newsmen, Sen. Aminu Tambuwal said they were at the Party to approach members of the NWC to transmit a letter to the leadership of the National Assembly for the party’s choice but were barred from seeing the leadership of the party. Similarly, Sen. Dickson urged the NWC to cause a letter to the National leadership, insisting that the PDP Senators have already arrived at their choice.
