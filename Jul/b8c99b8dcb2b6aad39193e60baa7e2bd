LAGOS  – The Rural Electrification Agency (REA), is deploying more mini-grid solar power stations in the country to mitigate the hike in costs of petroleum products following removal of fuel subsidy. Speaking in Gurin, Adamawa State, during inspection of a 100KW solar mini-grid power plant initiated by the agency, Managing Director of REA, Engr Ahmad Salihijo Ahmad, said the Gurin power plant is one of several such solar intervention projects developed by his agency under its Mass Electrification for Poverty Reduction Programme to support productive enterprises in face of risen energy costs. He said key is to ensure that this project goes to communities that have existing economic activities so that they are able to afford and use the power. He added: “This is a 100 kilowatt facility powering businesses, especially rice processing, in this town today. “We located the solar power station in Gurin because it is a hub for rice milling. Our projects are taken to communities known for economic activities, to power such activities.” According to him, the Gurin 100-kilowatt solar energy station has its own installation network supplying electricity to individual processors. Alhaji Mohammed Sani, Chairman of the community’s Rice Millers Association, said the project had been saving members of the association from the frustration of high energy costs.
