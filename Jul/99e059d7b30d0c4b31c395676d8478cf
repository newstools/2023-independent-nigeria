West Ham captain Declan Rice will undergo a medical ahead of completing his £105million move to Arsenal after the two clubs reached full agreement over his protracted move. The two London teams had been haggling over the payment structure linked to the £100m guaranteed portion of the fee. But the clubs have now settled on the fee being paid in three installments over 24 months, with Rice now due to undergo a medical ahead of signing his contract. Personal terms of a minimum £250,000 per week have already been agreed. Mail Sport were first to reveal last Wednesday that the two clubs had agreed the £105million fee in principle. The finer details of the deal have taken longer than expected to be confirmed but, as we reported, the transfer was ‘95 percent’ completed on Monday with the remaining formalities now tied up. The Gunners are also set to complete a £40million switch for Jurrien Timber from Ajax. Arsenal are planning for the Dutchman’s medical to take place by the end of the week. POLL Arsenal will allow Granit Xhaka to leave for Bayer Leverkusen for £21.5m once Rice is on board. (Daily Mail UK)
