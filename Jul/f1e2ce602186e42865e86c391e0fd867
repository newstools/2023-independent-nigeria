LAGOS  – A hearing for the suit filed by Trent Law Firm on behalf of His Royal Highness (HRH), Olatunde Oginni, at the High Court of Oyo State of Nigeria in the Ibadan Judiciary Division Holden at Ibadan in the matter of an application for the en­forcement of fundamental rights has been fixed for August 12. A human rights organisation, Access to Justice and Human Rights Protection in Nigeria, according to Oba Oginni, has shown interest in the matter as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the body, Nlerum Okogbule, has pledged to keep a watch on the legal proceedings and ensure that justice is served to who­ever erred in the infringement on the fundamental human right case. Recall that men in military uni­forms came with a caterpillar and destroyed properties worth millions of Naira on Friday, June 10, 2022, at The De Executive Suites located along Queen Elizabeth Road Ibadan, without any court order or valid court judgment which necessitate the business mogul and traditional leader to approach court demand­ing for justice over the illegal action. The respondents in the suit are the Attorney General of the Feder­ation, the Minister of Defence, the Nigerian Army, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), The General Officer Commanding (GOC) 2nd Mech­anised Division of the Nigerian Army, Adekunle Fajuyi Canton­ment, Ibadan Oyo State, and Major Banire, the former Commander, Operation Burst, Oyo State. “This is a case of gross misuse of power by some people in positions of authority, and a gross violation of our fundamental human right, by coming to destroy multi-million naira worth properties without any court order or valid court judgment from the military that accompanied the caterpillar for destruction,” the monarch said.
