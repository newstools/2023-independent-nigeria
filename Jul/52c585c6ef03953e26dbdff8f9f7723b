The Senate is to resume sitting today after the Eid-el-Kabir holiday. As the upper chamber resumes, majority and minority leaders are expected to emerge. The All Progressives Congress (APC) with the largest number of members is expected to produce the majority leader, while the op­position Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will produce the minority leader. While APC has 59 senators; PDP has 36; Labour Party (LP), eight; Social Democratic Party (SDP), two; New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), two; Young Peoples Party (YPP), one, and All Progres­sives Grand Alliance (APGA), one. This shows that seven political parties make up the membership of the 10th Senate, with 50 as oppo­sition members. The ruling APC and the mi­nority caucus are also expected to fill the vacant eight principal positions. While APC is expected to pro­duce the majority leader, deputy majority leader, chief whip and deputy chief whip, the four prin­cipal positions reserved for the mi­nority caucus are minority leader, deputy minority leader, minority whip and deputy minority whip. PDP, being the major opposi­tion party, is expected to produce the minority leader, deputy leader, minority whip and deputy minori­ty whip. POLL Nominations for the positions are purely the affairs of political parties with the majority of seats in the Senate. Findings show that the major contenders for the senate majority leader’s seat include: Sen. Opeyemi Bamidele (APC-Ekiti) and Sen. Mohammed Ndume (APC-Borno).
