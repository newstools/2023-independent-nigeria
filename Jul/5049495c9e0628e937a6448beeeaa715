The leader of the pan Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, has cautioned the Governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde against interfering in the group’s leadership issues. Adebanjo stated this while addressing reporters, on Wednesday. It could be recalled that Governor Makinde on Tuesday said he would work with other leaders to reconcile the two leaders of the group, Pa Ruben Fasoranti and Ayo Adebanjo. The governor had during a meeting held in Ibadan appealed to the two leaders to unite for the progress and unity of Yorubaland. Adebanjo, however, cautioned the governor against any attempt to split the group, saying he has no issue with Pa Fasoranti. According to him, “What Governor Makinde does not know about, he should not interfere. I have no dispute with Baba Fasoranti. He should not be one of those who want to split Afenifere, and that is not what I stand for”.
