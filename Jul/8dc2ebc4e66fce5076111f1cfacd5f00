AKURE  – Governor Oluwarotimi Ak­eredolu of Ondo State has extended his medical leave indefinitely in adherence to his doctor’s advice. This was contained in a letter he forwarded to the state House of Assembly on Monday. Akeredolu was expect­ing to resume office on Thursday, July 6, 2023, having applied for medical leave on June 5, 2023, but he didn’t resume. On Monday, the Speak­er, Ondo State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Ol­amide Oladiji, informed the House that he received a letter from the governor seeking extension of his medical leave. The letter signed by the speaker, entitled, ‘ODHA Receives Letter of Exten­sion on Medical Leave from Governor Akeredolu,’ read inter alia: “Follow­ing doctor’s advice on the need to take adequate rest after recuperating, Ondo State governor, Arakun­rin Oluwarotimi Odunayo Akeredolu SAN, CON, has forwarded the letter of ex­tension on medical leave to the Ondo State House of Assembly. “Receiving the letter on behalf of other lawmakers, the governor’s action is in line with Section 190 of the constitution of the Feder­al Republic of Nigeria (as amended). “According to the letter, his Deputy, Hon. Lucky Ai­yedatiwa, would continue to act as governor until there is a written declara­tion to the contrary.” That his deputy would “continue to act as gover­nor until there is a written declaration to the con­trary” makes the exten­sion of the medical leave indefinite.
