Civil rights advocacy group, Human Rights Writ­ers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), on Monday, said it would write world leaders over the failure of the Federal Government to arrest Niger Deltan and former agitator, Mujahid Asari-Dokubo, despite glaring evidence that he is a threat to the Nigeri­an state and the Nigerian people. HURIWA, in a statement by its national coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwu­biko, said it was concerned that the administration of President Bola Tinubu seems to be afraid of Asa­ri-Dokubo despite that the ex-agitator is threatening to destroy the country, saying he should be arrested for un­lawful possession of assault rifles and threat to the lives and property of Igbo people in the country. The group said the Tinu­bu government was creating a monster out of Asari-Do­kubo who dared the mili­tary to arrest him and that he would crumble Nigeria’s oil production to zero. HURIWA had previously issued a 72-hour ultimatum for the Federal Govern­ment to arrest Asari-Doku­bo over his suspected link to the violent phenomenon of ‘unknown gunmen’ in the South-East or risk un­precedented protests that would reverberate all over the country. Asari-Dokubo, who visit­ed Tinubu last month, had in a viral video brandished multiple AK-47 rifles and threatened to kill Igbos be­cause they supported La­bour Party’s Peter Obi in the February 25, 2023 presiden­tial poll against the ex-mil­itant’s preferred candidate of Tinubu, the then candi­date of the All Progressives Congress.
