The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has appealed to Dangote Cement PLC to honour its promise in respect to an incident that occurred in 2021. The student body made this disclosure via a statement made available to journalists on Sunday. It was gathered that an accident occurred that involved a truck of the cement company that claimed lives of 8 students of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko, included the then President of the Students’ Union Government, Adesomoju Samuel. NANS has however said that the cement company is yet to fulfill its promise made to the families of the victims. The student body in a statement signed by NANS Vice President External Affairs, Babatunde Afeez Akinteye said that it was surprised that the company is yet to fulfill its promise. Akinteye while speaking said that the student body has given the cement company a 14-day ultimatum to fulfill its promise. He added that the students body will restrict all vehicles of the cement company from all Nigerian roads if it failed to fulfill its promise within fourteen days. Akinteye said, “We write with great consternation mixed with an absolute shock, having been recently informed of the failure of DANGOTE CEMENT PLC to honour its promise to the families of the victims of the AAUA tragedy– which rocked the citadel of learning on the inauspicious afternoon of the 23rd of January, 2021, that claimed the life of the immediate past SUG PRESIDENT OF THE INSTITUTION ( SAMPRAISE). POLL “You will recall that the monumental tragedy, which claimed the lives of 8 promising students of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko, included the then President of the Students’ Union Government, Comr. Adesomoju Samuel– popularly known and addressed by the nickname “𝐒𝐀𝐌𝐏𝐑𝐀𝐈𝐒𝐄”, in what has now been described as the bloodiest day in AAUA history. “It is on record that both officially and publicly, subsequent to this mishap, DANGOTE CEMENT PLC, which is the parent company responsible for the tragedy, pledged to immediately immortalize the victims of the tragic mishap as part of its appeasement to their families. “However, it has recently come to our attention that the promise which in ordinary terms cannot equate the lives lost made by the company has not been taken with a pinch of salt let alone being fulfilled till date. This action, in itself, represents nothing but an unquantifiable sense of irresponsibility, insouciance and a lack of accountability, remorse, empathy and compassion on the families of all the deceased students. “Sequel to this, we write to issue a 14-day ultimatum to DANGOTE CEMENT PLC to fulfill the promise made to the families and as well immortalize the victims of the accident with immediate effect. Let it be stated in emphatic terms that failure to comply with this will be taken as a challenge to the association and by extension, barefaced affront to the entire populace of Nigerian students, which we shall not hesitate to confront with all sense of aggression by the RESTRICTION OF MOVEMENT OF ALL VEHICLES BELONGING TO DANGOTE CEMENT PLC IN SOUTH WEST, AND ALSO SHUTTING DOWN THEIR OPERATIONAL HEADQUARTER IN LAGOS. while also adopting other measures that the company may not be able to conceive let alone envisage even in their wildest imagination. “Having said this, we shall take a brief pause for now and watch, with a keen sense of observation, the chain of events that will happen within the next 14 days. A word is enough!”.
