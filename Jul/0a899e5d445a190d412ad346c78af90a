A 42-year-old man, Okwudili Orji, on Monday appeared before the court for allegedly stealing iron rods worth N5m in the Ejigbo area of Lagos State. He was arraigned on two counts bordering on stealing before Chief Magistrate Patrick Nwaka at the Yaba Magistrates’ Court. The prosecutor, Cyril Ejiofor, told the court that the offences Orji committed contravened Sections 314 and 287 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015. , “That you, Okwudili Orji, sometime in the month of September 2022, around 9am, at Bucknor Junction, Ejigbo, Lagos State, in the Lagos Magisterial District, did fraudulently obtained iron rods worth N5m, from one Uzoma Patrick, a representation which you knew to be false, and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015.” The charge read in part. The defence counsel, N. C. Okparauwa, pleaded with the court to admit his client to bail in the most liberal terms. With no argument against the plea by the prosecution, the magistrate admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N1m with two responsible sureties in like sum.
