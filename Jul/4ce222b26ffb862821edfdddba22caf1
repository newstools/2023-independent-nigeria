Indonesia on Tuesday strongly condemned an Israeli army raid in the West Bank city of Jenin. “The military attack is unacceptable and only worsens the humanitarian situation in Palestine and complicates peace efforts,” said Indonesia’s Foreign Affairs Ministry on Twitter. Israel’s actions must not go unpunished, and the UN Security Council (UNSC) must immediately adopt a resolute approach to consistently enforcing all of its resolutions. The death toll from the Israeli forces’ raid on the occupied West Bank city of Jenin has risen to nine. The Palestinian Health Ministry said 100 people were injured, with 20 of them in serious condition, during the Israeli military raid on Monday. Tensions have been running high across the occupied West Bank in recent months amid repeated Israeli raids into Palestinian towns. Nearly 190 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since the start of this year, according to the Health Ministry. At least 25 Israelis have also been killed in separate attacks during the same period.
