Governor Francis Nwifuru of Ebonyi State has commended the retired Commissioner of Police in the state, Sunday Olaleye, for combating crime and criminality. Olaleye retired from active service on Thursday this week. The state government held Gala Night on Friday to bid him farewell. Speaking during the event, Governor Francis Nwifuru described him as an intelligent police officer whose intelligence in the force led to the success recorded in the state in the fight against crime and criminality in the state. He commended him for his effort which led to the arrest of all those involved in the killing of an INEC official and the kidnap of his wife when they were returning from Abia State. Nwifuru also lauded Olaleye for the arrest of sit-at-home enforcers who terrorized some parts of the state this week and destroyed properties worth millions of naira. “I told CP, no matter it will take for the state to get this people arrested, I am interested. He told me give me 48 hours. After 48 hours, I didn’t get the result and he told me that the result will come in a very comprehensive manner. “The kidnapped woman was released in the night. In the morning by 12 o’clock, I got the result. All those that participated in that heinous crime were arrested. All of them have been arrested and they must face the law”, he said. The Governor urged the new Commissioner of Police in the state, Tina Ogbodo to also secure the state like her predecessor, Olaleye and assured that the government will continue to support security agents in the fight against crime in the state.
