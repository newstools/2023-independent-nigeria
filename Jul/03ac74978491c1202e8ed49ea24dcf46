A magistrate court in Iyaganku, Ibadan has on Monday ordered that a nursing mother, Damilola Opeyemi, be remanded in the Abolongo correctional facility, Oyo, for allegedly stabbing her husband to death over dinner. Magistrate P. O Adetuyibi, did not take her plea due to want of jurisdiction. Ms Adetuyibi said the remand is pending legal advice from the Oyo State Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP). She adjourned the matter until September 27 for mention. Ms Opeyemi is charged with murder. Earlier, police prosecution, Insp. Olalekan Adegbite told the court that Ms Opeyemi, on July 4, at about 8:30 p.m., caused the death of her husband. The prosecutor said, ”The couple who lived at Adogba Ajegede area, Ibadan, stabbed her husband, Oluwashina, 27, during a fight over noodles dinner.” He said the offence contravenes section 316 and is punishable under Section 319 of the Criminal Code Laws of Oyo State 2000.
