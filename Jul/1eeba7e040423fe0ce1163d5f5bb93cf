The Actors Guild of Nigeria, AGN, has suspended Nollywood actor, Jerry Williams indefinitely over his involvement with illicit substances over a long period of time. According to Precious Eze Blog, the National President of the actors union body, AGN, Ejezie Emeka-Rollas revealed that the guild had been monitoring Williamsâ€™ involvement with illicit drug substances since December 2022 and ought to have been suspended before now but decided to allow him to go through minor treatments to see if he could salvage himself, but had been defaulting over time. In its report, the blog quoted Emeka Rollas as saying that over time, the actor has become a huge risk, not only to himself but to other performers who might be performing with him on set where he is called to perform as an actor. Continuing, the AGN National President says Jerry Williams remains suspended until he is able to get a clean slate from approved and appropriate institutions handling drug abuse cases. For clarity, the AGN President reiterates that the constitution of the association frowns at any member using illicit drugs, moreso when AGN is a respecter of the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, especially with our strong partnership the association had with the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA in 2022, which involved the agency going to our locations occasionally to check on members who get involved with illicit drug use.
