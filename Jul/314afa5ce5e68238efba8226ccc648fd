“Speedily with consistent policies formation/execution and brilliant team gathering, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is taking Nigerians out from decades of bad leadership and poverty” This was stated by a chieftain of All Progressives Congress, APC in Alimosho Federal Constituency, Lagos Hon. Adesina Egbetokun in a press statement signed by his head of media team, Femi Ikugbayigbe and made available to Journalists in Lagos, today. Egbetokun said with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Nigerians should keep their hope alive, noting that the progress made so far by the President within his short period in office should convince the doubting Thomas and haters who were doubting his leadership capacity during the electioneering campaign that, he (Asiwaju) has the sagacious ability to lead the country to a greater height. The United States of America,(USA) certified Economist said Nigerians should rest assured that the economic policies of President Tinubu will deliver the nation from decades of shackles of poverty. Egbetokun said Tinubu’s full preparation to lead the nation can easily be attested to through his few selective appointments of brilliant, professional team members. The humanitarian politician said President Tinubu’s Renewed Hope agenda will set Nigeria free from the bandage of poverty to a nation of plenty. “Nigerians should have strong faith in President Tinubu’s administration, he has started on a very good note, his economy policies show he is ready to take Nigerians out of penury.” It will be recalled that Egbetokun a certified Accountant and Data Processing Analyst contested the APC primary and stepped down for the current member of the House of Representatives, representing Alimosho Federal Constituency, Hon. Barr. Ganiyu Adele Ayuba Esq due to party supremacy and unwaveringly supported the party (APC) to earn the victory recorded during the Presidential and Governorship elections in Lagos State.
