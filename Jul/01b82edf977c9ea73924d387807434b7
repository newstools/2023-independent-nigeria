Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is en route to Bulgaria to meet Sofia’s political leaders. Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolai Denkov confirmed the news of Zelenskyy’s visit Thursday, details of which had begun to leak out earlier this week. Denkov said that Zelenskyy will land around 10 a.m. His program includes a potentially fraught meeting with Bulgarian President Rumen Radev, who is hostile to arming Kyiv. Zelenskyy’s visit will focus on discussions about weapons to Ukraine and cooperation on nuclear power station supplies. Bulgaria’s parliament also was expected to pass a declaration of support for Ukraine to join the NATO military alliance.
