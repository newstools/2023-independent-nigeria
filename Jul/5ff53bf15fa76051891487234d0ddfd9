A former Minister of State for Labour, Festus Keyamo, has reacted to the ongoing drama surrounding the confession of Anambra State student, Mmesoma Ejikeme, who forged her 2023 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) results. Anambra State Governor Charles Soludo had set up a eight-member panel to investigate the controversies surrounding the results. The panel headed by Professsor Nkemdili Nnonyelu, confirmed Mmesoma forged the score of 362 as earlier claimed by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB). According to the report submitted to the governor, Mmesoma confirmed she single-handedly forged the result before approaching a cyber cafe for printing. Reacting to this, Keyamo in a post said he deliberately waited for the end of the investigation before commenting on the matter. He wrote: “I deliberately waited for the end of this investigation before commenting on this unfortunate case of our daughter, Mmesoma Ejikeme. “She’s a brilliant girl, judging by her actual score of 249. The nation should be careful not to destroy her. What she needs is counselling, correction and guidance. She obviously did not know the weight and gravity of what she was doing. As teenagers, most of us made juvenile mistakes that never came to light. “The parents should encourage her to do a public apology to JAMB, to her family and to Nigerians after which she should be allowed to get her admission based on her actual scores. Anyone still pushing other narratives over this issue is not helping her and her family. POLL “It is time to close this very unfortunate chapter and move on. This is my plea.”
