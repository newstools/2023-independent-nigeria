The landmark achievements recorded by the Ogun State government in the teaching of Mathematics have been ascribed to the concerted ef­forts of the Subject Associa­tions, who served as major partners with the govern­ment in shaping the lives of learners for outstanding per­formances in schools across the state. Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Educa­tion, Science and Technol­ogy, Abosede Ogunleye, made this known during a familiarisation visit of the newly-elected state ex­ecutive of the Mathemati­cal Association of Nigeria (MAN), saying the Associ­ation has been a major in­fluence on the teaching of the subject and had helped learners to develop more interest in the subject un­like before. Ogunleye, according to Ministry’s Press Officer, Ayoola Obadimu, said the huge investment of the pres­ent administration in edu­cation has complemented the strides of Mathematics teachers, and had enabled the state to write its name on milestones of success, particularly in competitions both at the state and national levels. According to Ogunleye: “We want to appreciate your Association for cooperating with the Ministry to achieve feats. Our partnership has led to more achievements in the education sector of the State”.
