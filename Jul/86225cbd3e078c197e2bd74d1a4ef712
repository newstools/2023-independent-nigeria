A female student-athlete of the University of Lagos, UNILAG, Olasubomi Ogundele, has offered scholarships to 10 pupils of her alma mater, Iganmode Grammar School in Ota, Ogun state. During her visit to the school, Olasubomi donated sports items, organised a seminar for the students on the topic: ‘Combining Education and Sports’. There was also a novelty match between her grassroots club, Alimosho Sports Club, and the Iganmode Grammar School football team. Olasubomi, who was the highest goal scorer of the female football competition during the last edition of NUGA Games in Lagos, said her vision has been to help other young, budding athletes build self-esteem and confidence in pursuing their dreams. “That you play football does not mean you are not responsible. Have that determination and discipline, let the society know that you have a lot of things to offer,” she said. Commending her effort for giving back to her school since 2020, the school principal, Alhaji Olayinka Janto, told the school’s alumni body to consider Olasubomi as an ambassador of the school. “I appeal to the Alunmi body to please in your next old students’ association meeting, make sure you recognise Olasubomi Ogundele as an ambassador of Iganmode Grammar School,” he said.
