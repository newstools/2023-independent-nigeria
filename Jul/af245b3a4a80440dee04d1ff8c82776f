Russia and Cuba have resumed regular flight services between the two countries today. The service was suspended since April 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic and later due to international sanctions on Moscow for its military campaign in Ukraine. A Boeing 777 aircraft belonging to Rossiya Airlines, a subsidiary of Aeroflot, the national airline of Russia, took off this Saturday from Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, heading to the Cuban resort of Varadero. “The demand for tickets was enormous,” said Sergei Starikov, spokesperson for Rossiya Airlines, to the official Russian news agency TASS. He emphasized that the first flight had an occupancy rate of “almost 100%.” During the initial stage, Rossiya Airlines will operate two weekly flights to Varadero on Mondays and Saturdays, which will be increased to three starting from September. According to the Russian government, it is expected that the resumption of regular flights will result in an annual flow of over 150,000 Russian tourists traveling to Cuba.
