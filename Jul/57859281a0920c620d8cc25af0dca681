African airlines cargo declined in the month of May by 2.4 per cent, when compared to the same period in 2022, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said. Apart from Africa, IATA also said that the global air cargo markets for May 2023 received a decline. According to IATA, the 2.4 per cent decline in cargo movement by African airlines was also a reduction of 0.9 per cent when compared to April 2023. The association said that notably, the growth on the Africa to Asia trade route slowed significantly in May from 18.5 per cent in April to 11 per cent, possibly due to the impact of the conflict in Sudan since mid-April. However, capacity in May was up 9.2 per cent compared to the same month in 2022. IATA added that Global demand, measured in cargo tonne-kilometers (CTKs), fell 5.2 per cent compared to May 2022 (-6 per cent for international operations). Capacity, as measured by available cargo tonne-kilometers (ACTKs), rose 14.5 per cent compared to May 2022, primarily driven by belly capacity, which increases as demand in the passenger business recovers. Capacity is now 5.9 per cent above May 2019 (pre-pandemic) levels. The global manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) indicates an annual contraction of 1.4 per cent in new export orders and a decrease of 5.2 per cent year-on-year in production PMI. POLL This suggests a cooling in global manufacturing demand. Global goods trade decreased by 0.8 per cent in April due to macroeconomic challenges and supply chain constraints. Trading conditions appeared to favour maritime cargo as demand for container shipping contracted by 0.2 per cent, while air cargo demand weakened by 6.3 per cent year-on-year. The global supplier delivery time PMI increased to 54.5 in May, up from its low of 35 in October 2021, indicating shorter delivery times and some relief for supply chains. However, this is also a sign of weaker global goods trade demand. “Trading conditions for air cargo continue to be challenging with a 5.2 per cent fall in demand and several economic indicators pointing towards weakness. The second half of the year, however, should bring some improvements. “As inflation moderates in many markets, it is widely expected that central bank rate hikes will taper. This should help stimulate economic activity with a positive impact on demand for air cargo,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director-General. Asia-Pacific airlines saw their air cargo volumes decrease by 3.3 per cent in May 2023 compared to the same month in 2022. This was a decrease in performance compared to April (-0.3 per cent), mainly due to the stronger annual contraction in international air cargo demand from -3.5 per cent in April to -6.4 per cent this month. Available capacity in the region increased by 38.3 per cent compared to May 2022 as more belly capacity came online from the passenger side of the business. North American carriers saw the weakest performance of all regions for the third consecutive month with an 8.1 per cent decrease in cargo volumes in May 2023 compared to the same month in 2022. This was a slight improvement in performance compared to April (-12.4 per cent). Notably, airlines in the region saw the third month of double-digit contractions in volumes on the North America-Europe trade lane (-10.3 per cent). Capacity increased 1.2 per cent compared to May 2022. European carriers experienced a 6.7 per cent decrease in cargo volumes in May 2023, compared to the same month in 2022. This was an improvement in performance compared to April (-7.7 per cent), in part due to the smaller annual contraction in international CTKs on the Europe-Middle East trade lane, from -4.7 per cent in April to -2.9 per cent in May. The decline in international cargo traffic on markets within-Europe also improved from -16.2 per cent in April to -7.8 per cent this month (seasonally adjusted). Meanwhile, capacity increased 5.6 per cent in May 2023 compared to May 2022. Middle Eastern carriers experienced a 3.1 per cent year-on-year decrease in cargo volumes in May 2023.
