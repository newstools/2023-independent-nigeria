Bishop of Sokoto Catholic Di­ocese, Matthew Kukah, has ad­vised the Federal Government to enforce the provision on free­dom of religion and worship especially in Northern Nigeria, as enshrined in the nation’s constitution and other laws of the land. The bishop who spoke to journalists shortly after the inaugural Mass at the Catholic Chaplaincy of the 119 Composite Group of the Nigeria Air Force, Sokoto, said this can be achieved by providing adherents of dif­ferent faiths in the country with places of worship in the various Federal Government establish­ments. Bishop Kukah observed that most Federal Government estab­lishment in the North have no provisions for places of worship for Christians which is in breach of the constitutional provision.
