The Police Service Commis­sion has approved the ap­pointment and deployment of eight Commissioners of Police to state commands in the country. The commission also commended the acting In­spector General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, for ad­hering to its latest policy on gender sensitivity in his recommendation. The commission, how­ever, expects that the In­spector General in his sub­sequent proposals would include more officers of North East and South East geopolitical zones that are yet to record the benchmark of 15 percent as decided at its last Plenary Meeting . The newly appointed State Commissioners of Po­lice are Godwin Aghaulor now Cp Bornu State Com­mand; Adelesi E. Olu­warotimi, CP Kwara State Command; Adebola Ayinde Hamzat, CP Oyo State Com­mand; Augustina Ogbodo, CP Ebonyi State Command and Samuel Titus Musa, CP Kebbi State Command. Others are Aderemi Olufemi Adeoye, CP Anam­bra State Command; Ste­phen Olarewaju, CP Imo State Command and Ala­matu Abiodun Mustapha, CP Ogun State Command.
