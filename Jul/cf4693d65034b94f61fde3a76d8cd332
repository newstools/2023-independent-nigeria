Paris Saint-Germain have reportedly identified Victor Osimhen as their top target should Kylian Mbappe leave this summer, but Napoli are hard at work on a new deal for their striker. The Ligue 1 giants, regularly at the centre of the gossip mill in European football, have been in a state of chaos after their star man Mbappe confirmed his intention to leave on a free transfer next year. PSG are now seemingly desperate to sell Mbappe, not wanting to lose the French star for nothing, and have set their sights on Osimhen as a possible replacement. Pages 12 and 13 of today’s Gazzetta dello Sport highlight how Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis made it clear that only a club like PSG could afford Osimhen this summer. A €100m bid for the Nigerian striker was rejected last month and it would take around €180-200m to secure his signature this transfer window. In the meantime, Napoli are in talks with Osimhen’s agent Roberto Calenda, trying to tie down the 24-year-old to a new deal. The current idea is to extend his contract by a year or two, raise his salary from the current €4.5m net, and include a release clause set at around €100m.
