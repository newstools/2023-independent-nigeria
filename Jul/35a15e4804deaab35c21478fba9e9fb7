The Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) said it was deeply saddened and shocked by the news of the passing on of one of its committed members and Publisher of NewsDirect Newspapers Group, Dr Samu­el Ibiyemi on Tuesday. Aged 56, Dr. Ibiyemi suc­cumbed to death at the Bab­cock University Teaching Hospital, Ilisan, Ogun State, where he was undergoing treatment. In a statement on Wednes­day by the NGE President, Eze Anaba and its General Secretary, Dr. Iyobosa Uwug­iaren, the professional body of all the editors in Nigeria described the late publish­er as a committed member of the NGE, who made his mark in the journalism profession as a reporter, business editor, editor and publisher. ‘’Even when Dr. Samu­el Ibiyemi was struggling between life and death on his sick bed at the hospital, he was still breathing jour­nalism; he wanted to know from his colleagues the latest happenings on our society; he called to find out the out­come of the national bienni­al convention of the NGE in Owerri. ‘’We were regularly in touch with him and his fam­ily; he assured us of his de­termination to survive; we were looking forward to him coming out of the Babcock University Teaching Hospital in Ilisan, where he was under­going treatment. ‘’Dr. Ibiyemi was passion­ate about the journalism pro­fession and played his part in various newspapers before birthing his publication, Nigerian NewsDirect, some 13 years ago. He was a com­mitted member of the NGE, and we take solace in the fact that he made his mark in the profession, as a reporter, edi­tor and publisher, before his home call. His legacy, NewsDi­rect Newspapers, has contin­ued to make an impact with its rich content: informing, educating and entertaining readers, since it was created’’, the editors stated.
