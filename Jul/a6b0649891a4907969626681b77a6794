The Minority Leader of the Bayelsa State House of Assembly, Mr Edward Irigha-Brigidi, was arrested and released by operatives of the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team of the Nigeria Police Force at the weekend in Yenagoa. Daily Independent learned that the state legislator, who represents Nembe Constituency II on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was picked up by the SWAT operatives at the Azikoro area of the state capital. The SWAT detectives were said to have stormed the state from Abuja, acting on a petition against the lawmaker. Irigha-Brigidi was, however, later freed while he was being whisked away to Abuja following the intervention of the Bayelsa State government, some of his political associates and the traditional rulers. He confirmed in a statement on Monday that his arrest was based on allegations levelled against him “by those who are not happy that I am standing shoulder to shoulder with my beloved constituents that gave me their mandate.” Irigha-Brigidi said, “The police who requested to search my residences at Opu-Nembe and Yenagoa later released me immediately when they did not find any incriminating evidence, contrary to the petition that had prompted the arrest. “I am aware that the Gestapo-like arrest was politically Motor voted by desperate politicians who seek to silence me. What they fail to realise is that God and my people are with me. “Let me admit that members of the Bayelsa State Police Command demonstrated utter professionalism in handling the precarious situation and I am indebted to them. POLL “To the glory of God, I have since been released and reunited with my family and I urge my constituents and the people of Opu-Nembe to remain calm, peaceful and go about with their normal businesses. “My people should be assured that this nefarious attempt to implicate me will not deter me from always working for our collective interest.”
