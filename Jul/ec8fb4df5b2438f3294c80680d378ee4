The lawmaker representing Ngor Okpala/Aboh Mbaise Federal Constituency of Imo State at the House of Represen­tatives, Dr. Matthew Nwogu, has said that he is disturbed by the lack of federal presence in his area and would work to change the situation. The Labour Party’s (LP) lawmaker further assured that he will not be far from his con­stituents as he would not make Abuja his new home. The first term lawmaker said he would work to deliver on his campaign promises one of which is to give his people effective representation. “I’m not in Abuja to repre­sent myself but the good peo­ple of Ngor Okpala and Aboh Mbaise. And one of the things that disturbs me is the lack of federal presence in my area which I have to work hard to change,” Nwogu said. The legal luminary vowed to pursue vigorously the in­stitutionalisation of Nigeri­an youths development and empowerment programmes through legislative frameworks, insisting on the need for the na­tion’s recognition of her youths as the bedrock for future devel­opment. “One area we have to focus on as lawmakers is how to se­cure the future of our youths. We have to make laws that will benefit the youths and make them believe in the Nigerian project,” Nwogu stated. He described the 10th Nation­al Assembly as an assemblage of like minds that are committed to good, visionary and purposeful leadership in Nigeria through robust legislative activities.
