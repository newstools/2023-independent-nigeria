Four men were arraigned before an Ota Magistrates’ Court in Ogun for allegedly defrauding five persons of N2.6 million. The News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, reports that the police charged Nwusulor Philip, 28; Sunday Basil, 28; Mbam Stephen, 31; and Nwafor Solomon, whose addresses were not provided, with fraud, collecting money under false pretence and conspiracy. The Prosecutor, Insp E.O.Adaraloye, told the court that the defendants and others still at large committed the offences between Feb.1 and June 30 at No.1 Obalewo Close, Off Ago Ishaga, Ota. Adaraloye alleged that the defendants and their accomplices conspired to obtain N2.6 million, under the pretext of working with Quest International Company, from the complainants to introduce them to internet business. He said the complainants were: Husanni Abdulrahman, Faisat Saidu, Yahaya Magaji, Sulaiman Usman, and Shuaibu Saddam. “The defendants converted the monies to personal use instead of fulfilling the agreement between them,” he said. The prosecutor said the offences contravened sections 390(9), 419, and 516 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ogun, 2006. They, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. POLL The Magistrate, Mrs A. O. Adeyemi, granted bail to the defendants in the sum of N2 million each with one surety in like sum. Adeyemi ordered that the surety must reside within the court’s jurisdiction and be gainfully employed with evidence of tax payment to the Ogun State Government. She adjourned the case until August 17 for further hearing.
