LAFIA – The Nasarawa State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress Stakeholders Forum on Thursday demanded the arrest of the former chairman of Karu Local Government Area Hon. Samuel Akala, for allegedly hiding under the cover of concerned APC stakeholders to cause unrest within the party. Honourable Kassim Muh’d Kassim, the State Chairman, of the Council of APC Stakeholders Forum, made the demand in a press conference held in Lafia the state capital. The forum leader said the self-acclaimed APC concerned stakeholders group were using their name and forum for impersonation. Said he,” I want to set the records straight that there is no group like Concerned Nasarawa APC Stakeholders known to anybody in Nasarawa State, the only existing one known to everybody is the one headed by Dr Kassim, which is APC Stakeholders Forum. “The Concern APC Stakeholders is not recognised by either the party or the Government of Nasarawa State and they have no authority to speak on any issue in the state because, they are a faceless group. “Their actions are solely aimed at causing unrest and defaming, and we urgently appeal for their apprehension, as there is no legitimate organization bearing that name in our State. ” we feel compelled to address the baseless accusations and slanderous assaults directed at the Chief Judge and our esteemed Governor, which are evidently motivated by personal agendas rather than genuine concerns,” Honourable Kassim said. POLL He also dared Daniel Ogazi, that he cannot be the speaker under the current administration because the house was properly inaugurated by the clerk and Balarabe was returned as Speaker and normal legislative activities have since been going on. Honourable Kassim Muhammed Kassim, advised Honourable Daniel Ogazi-led team to accept defeat and return to the Assembly for their constituents, who voted them in for effective representation and not for a leadership tussle.
