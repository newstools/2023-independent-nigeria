LAGOS – Hoodlums suspected to be land grabbers have unleashed mayhem on some communities in Ogun State. Saturday INDEPENDENT gathered that the incident start­ed on Thursday morning and continued on Friday, forcing residents to remain indoors, while shops were closed for fear of being killed by stray bullets. The hoodlums were said to have shot sporadically during the attack on Onibuku, Baba Ode, Oju-Alale and NAHCO communities, all along Idiroko Expressway, Ota, Ogun State. The residents are appealing to the police to come to their aid in order to save their lives and property. Residents are fleeing in droves following the incessant onslaught of land speculators, known as ‘Omo onile.’ Those that stayed behind, especially landlords are living in perpetual fear, as they can no longer sleep with their two eyes closed due to the growing intimidation of the heavily armed gangs of the indigenous speculators. A resident from the area who did not want his name in print told Saturday Independent that residents of the affected area could not come out since Thursday and are living in fear. “Please let the police come to our rescue at Onibuku, Baba Ode, Oju Alare and NAHCO, all along Idiroko Express Way , Ota Ogun State, as violence has erupted again between gun-toting rival land grabbers in the areas. POLL It started yesterday. Please use your influence to call the police to come to our aid. Shops cannot open. There is unease among the residents,” the res­ident said in a Save- Our- Soul telephone call to Saturday Inde­pendent,” he said Another resident who spoke to Saturday INDEPENDENT said that the police should be aware of the incident because the shooting was too much. “The affected areas are un­der Iju Police Division in Ota, Ogun State,” adding that res­idents have not seen the pres­ence of the police to contain the violence attack.
