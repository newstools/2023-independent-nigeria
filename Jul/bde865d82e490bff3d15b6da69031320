The 21-year-old midfielder was a bit part player at Bayern Munich last season and has been vocal about wanting to play regular football. Liverpool are amongst the clubs who are interested in getting their hands on the Dutch midfielder in the ongoing transfer window. And it has been claimed that the Dutchman is not now attracting interest from clubs in Italy this summer. According to Italian broadcaster Sportitalia, AC Milan have probed the possibility of getting their hands on the Bayern Munich midfielder. The Rossoneri want to add to their midfield after the imminent departure of Sandro Tonali to Newcastle for a deal worth up to â‚¬80m. Gravenberch is a player they like and the Serie A giants are weighing up potentially signing him this summer. But for the moment, Bayern Munich do not want to move him on and even he is expecting to stay with the Bavarians. It remains to be seen if that stance changes if more clubs show an interest in Gravenberch this summer.
