Barcelona president Joan Laporta has admitted he believes a deal will be reached to sell centre-back Clement Lenglet to Tottenham. Lenglet joined Spurs on loan for last season and made 35 appearances in all competitions, but Spurs declined to trigger their option to buy the defender permanently. Now officially back at Barcelona, Lenglet is up for sale once again and Laporta believes the Frenchman will find his way back to Spurs. “I think we’ll reach an agreement with Tottenham for Lenglet,” Laporta revealed to La Vanguardia. “This almost never goes fast. It depends on the other party.” Lenglet still has three years remaining on his Barcelona contract, having inked a six-year deal back in 2020 when he was emerging as one of the Blaugrana’s top defenders. After falling down the pecking order, Lenglet found his way to Tottenham last season and played a major role for the Premier League side, although a mixed run of form left fans divided on whether he should be signed permanently. Spurs are known to be keen to bolster at centre-back this summer and have explored deals for a handful of targets, most recently making contact with Wolfsburg over Dutchman Micky van de Ven. Another leading Bundesliga centre-back, Edmond Tapsoba of Bayer Leverkusen, is known to be on Spurs’ radar – both targets operate on the left-side of a traditional centre-back pairing like Lenglet.
