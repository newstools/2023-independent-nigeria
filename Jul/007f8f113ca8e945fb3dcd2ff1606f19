Moves by the Lagos State Ministry of Transportation MOT since 2021 to harmonise the operations of light freight operators in the state into one entity for easy Transport Policy implementation, administrative ease and peaceful co-existence is being stalled by a law suit filed at the National Industrial Court sitting at Ikoyi by one of the four different associations involved. In an exclusive chat with Daily Independent, Comrades Rahmon Salam, State Chairman, Ifesowapo National Tippers and Ajeigboro Transport Association (INATAN), Oni Babatunde, State Chairman, Allied Trucks Transporters Association of Nigeria (ATTAN), and Lukmon Akindele, State Chairman, Lagos Ogun Tippers Workers Welfare Association (LOTWWA), gave insights and reasons as to why the it became critical and inevitable for the government of the State to harmonise the operations of Truck and Tipper transportation in the Lagos state. According to the trio, “Following series of factions operating in the freighting of light goods, sands, limestones and related items, leading to conflicts, wrangling and territorial tussles amongst four associations, including the Union of Tippers and Quarry Employers of Nigeria (UTQEN), creating public unrest, the State government in 2021 decided to group the warring associations into one, proffering a suitable rotational administrative structure that is sure to gratify each of the association but was rejected by one of the member association, which eventually took the remaining parties to court. “The four Associations involved in the proposed grouping by the Lagos State government include; Union of Tippers and Quarry Employers of Nigeria (UTQEN); Allied Trucks Transporters Association of Nigeria (ATTAN); Ifesowapo National Tippers and Ajeigboro Transport Association (INATAN) and Lagos Ogun Tippers Workers Welfare Association (LOTWWA). ”The Lagos State government through the Ministry of Transportation had in a bid to harmonise our various factional associations into a formidable association or union wrote letters to each of us, dated20, October, 2021 and signed by a ranking officer on behalf of the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, asking them to come together in furtherance of the resolution reached with representatives of association at a Stakeholders meeting held at the Ministry conference room on the 13, October, 2021 which emphasized that; “All different Associations operating trucks and tippers in the State regarding sand granite and others should jointly form a single body to manage, monitor and supervise the operation of members in the Transportation Sector in order to streamline our activities in line with Transport Sector Reform Law 2018, and White Paper on Transport Union activities 2004.” They asserted. The title of the letter made available reads: The Need To Form A Single Body To Manage, Monitor and Supervise The Operations Of Sand, Granite and Truck Operations, states; I am directed to inform you to form a single body to represent the interest of your members. Consequently, the following Associations and others are to comply with the resolution agreed upon at stakeholder meeting of the State: Union of Tippers and Quarry Employers of Nigeria (UTQEN), Allied Truck Transporters Association of Nigeria (ATTAN), Ifesowapo National Tippers and Ajeigboro Transport Association (INATAN) and Lagos Ogun Tippers Workers Welfare Association (LOTWWA). POLL Stressing the importance of coming under one umbrella, and the need for it to be duly registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) as the State Government will only recognize a single body for Stakeholder engagement and other activities. Though the representatives of each of the Associations were present at the merger meeting held at the Ministry of transportation and accented to the arrangement, but the Union of Tippers and Quarry Employers of Nigeria (UTQEN) reneged afterwards, refusing to append its signatures to the outcome of their agreement to form a united body with the name; Union of Trucks, Tippers and Ajeigboro Workers Association of Nigeria UTTAWAN, they affirmed. They further revealed that after submitting a letter dated March 4, 2022, to the State Ministry of Transportation informing them of their decision to unite as a single body in the State with UTTAWAN as their adopted name, a respond was given by the State Ministry recognizing it with constituent membership of three of the four operating associations, excluding the Union of Tippers and Quarry Employers of Nigeria (UTQEN). The letter of recognition by the Ministry reads in part; “I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 4 March, 2022, on the above subject and to convey the approval of the Ministry for the formation and recognition of Union of Trucks, Tippers & Ajeigboro Workers of Nigeria (UTTAWAN) as the new corporate body (union) formed by the following Unions: Allied Trucks Transporters Association of Nigeria (ATTAN), Ifesowapo National Tippers and Ajeigboro Transport Association, (INATAN), Lagos Ogun Tippers Workers Welfare Association (LOTWWA). “Consequently, the Union (UTTAWAN) is expected to manage, monitor, supervised and streamline the activities of its members for a common interest and goal, thereby ensuring peace and tranquility in the State, the Union is also expected to provide the structure and list of 12 (twelve), Members Board of trustee (BOT) comprising of 3 persons each from the former, Associations and the composition of such shall be rotated every four (4) years among the former Associations”, he letter expressed. However in a twist of event, they said, UTQEN decided to go to the National Industrial Court in Ikoyi to challenge UTTAWAN for agreeing to form a united body in line with the plan of the Lagos State Ministry of Transportation who was also summoned as the second defendant, the State government is the third defendant while the Attorney General of the State is the fourth defendant.
