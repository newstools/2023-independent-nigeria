AKURE  – Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Min­istries, Adewale Giwa, on Sunday described those commending President Bola Ahmed Tinubu as hypocrites and enemies of Nigeria. He stated this while address­ing members of his church in Akure, Ondo State capital, on the state of the nation. The cleric wondered why people were defending the hike in pump price of Premium Mo­tor Spirit (PMS) to N500, N550 per litre as a normal thing after the removal of the oil subsidy by President Tinubu. He queried how poor people and the unemployed are expected to survive in such a situation. Giwa stated that “Tinubu took the mantle of leadership as 16th president of Nigeria on May 29, 2023. “In his inaugural speech after the swearing-in, the President completed the removal of the fuel subsidy, which was started by his predecessor with his con­troversial “fuel subsidy is gone” statement. “Currently, fuel price has jumped to between N500 and N550 per litre from N187 pre- May 29. “Despite its oil riches, Nigeria is unable to refine crude locally to meet demands. POLL “The four state-owned re­fineries are moribund, forcing the country to import refined petroleum products, which are then sold at a price fixed by the government. “President Tinubu also signed the Electricity Bill and Students’ Loans Bill into law, and also sacked security chiefs and re­placed them with officers drawn from many geo-political zones of the country and religious affili­ations.” According to Giwa: “Those praising the President are gull­ible enough to believe that selling a litre of petrol at N550 is good for the country where people are sur­viving without jobs. “You cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stay there. Where are the refineries that are functioning in Nigeria? “How many of us can boast that we have jobs that can help us confront these challenges that we face in Nigeria? It is senseless to remove fuel subsidies without alternatives.”
