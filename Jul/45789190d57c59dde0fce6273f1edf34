AKURE – Billionaire business mogul and senator representing Ondo South, Dr. Jimoh Ibrahim, has declared that those wishing Governor Oluwarotimi Ak­eredolu dead would die before him. Piqued by the way Akeredo­lu’s health was turned to na­tional discourse, Senator Ibra­him wondered why the medical issue of Akeredolu was turned to something out of this world as if he’s the first to fall sick. Ibrahim noted that immedi­ate past President Muhamma­du Buhari was sick for a very long time but didn’t raise much dust as Akeredolu’s. He said: “I want to express my displeasure in the way peo­ple are talking about Arakun­rin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu’s health as if he’s the first public office holders to fall sick. “We are all in this country when former President Mu­hammadu Buhari was out of the country for medical atten­tion for about six months. “I can bet you, those wicked and evil people who are wish­ing Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu dead will die before him by God’s grace.”
