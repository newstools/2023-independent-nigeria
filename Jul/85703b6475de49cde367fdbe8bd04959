Mr. Adewale-Smatt Oyerinde, NECA’s Director General, while commending the intervention of the President, told Daily Independent that the issue of multiplicity of taxes has become a major challenge to organised businesses in the country. He said: “ Currently businesses are made to pay over fifty different taxes and sundry charges, among which are: Corporate Income tax, Import duties, Export duties, Excise duties, Rents, Capital Gains tax, Personal Income tax, Value Added tax, Stamp duties, Property tax, Licenses, Motor Parking fee, Motor Vehicle fee, Withholding tax, Land tax, Market License fee, Road tax, Business Premises, dividend tax, NHIS levy, Advert fee, Regulation fees, the new NYSC levy as well as the regular user charges such as electricity, water, disposal fee. “These huge tax burden, no doubt, has been a clog in the wheel of overall performance of organised businesses over the years. We had, at numerous fora expressed concern on the escalation of taxes including exercise duties and its adverse implication on the business operating environment”. Oyerinde noted that “we are indeed elated with the news of the Executive Orders, particularly with the suspension of the 5% Excise Tax on telecommunication services; suspension of Excise Duties on Tobacco (30% ad valorem rate with the introduction of specific rate of NGN 4.2/stick of cigarette for 2022; N4.7 per stick for 2003; and N5.2/stick in 202); Beer (N40/lite in 2002; N45/lite in 2023 and N50/lite 2024); and Wine/Spirit (20% ad valorem rate with a specific rate of N50/litre in 2022) as proposed in the 2022 Fiscal Policy Statement. “The suspension of 10% Green Tax by way of Excise Tax on Single Use Plastics (SUPs), including plastics containers and bottles; Import Tax Adjustment (IAT) of 2% on imported ]4% on 4000 cc engines. The new Ormotor vehicles of 2000 cc to 3999 and ders will no doubt, support the efforts at improving the operating environment and mitigate the high cost of doing business in Nigeria, particularly with the aftermath of the removal of fuel subsidy”. He noted that: “in view of consolidating the gains that these interventions would facilitate, the NECA Boss urged that “beyond the definitive pronouncements of the President, we urge Mt President to also reconsider the VAT imposition on Automated Gas Oil (AGO) among some other urgent interventions. POLL “The reversal of the VAT will in no small measure ameliorate the escalating cost of energy and transportation cost currently being witnessed”. He, however, said: “As a follow-up action, we urge Government to: Publish the list of approved harmonised taxes and levies by the Joint Tax Board (JTB) to address the issues of multiples taxes and levies; Design and Implement measures that would draw informal sector businesses to the formal sector so as to widen the tax net for increased tax revenue”.
