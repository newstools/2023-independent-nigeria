In a bid to enhance public safety and equal access to security services in the country and in a ground­breaking development, the Act­ing Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Olukayode Adeolu Egbe­tokun, has unveiled a transfor­mative plan to withdraw Police Mobile Force (PMF) personnel from Very Important Persons (VIPs) and establish a Special Intervention Squad. The move, according to the Ag. IGP, is to revolutionise the traditional approach to security operations and make a signif­icant paradigm shift towards improving Nigeria’s internal security architecture. In his inaugural address, the newly appointed Ag. IGP expressed his unwavering commitment to combatting crime in the nation, boldly proclaiming himself a fear­less guardian ready to take on criminals. True to his words, he wasted no time in rolling out his strategic action plans, which include the formation of a Special Intervention Squad to be deployed across all 36 states of the federation, including the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, as well as areas prone to terrorist attacks. He said the proposal to with­draw PMF personnel from VIPs and establish the Special Intervention Squad represents a departure from the conven­tional procedures followed by previous IGPs. Recognising the urgency and gravity of the situation, Ag. IGP Egbetokun initiated an unusual yet workable pro­cess. It was also gathered that to guide the implementation of the policy, he has set up a dedicated committee while ex­ploring the utilisation of super­numerary officers, as stipulated in Sections 23 to 25 of the Police Act 2020. “One of the key driving fac­tors behind this decision is the alarming prevalence of abuse suffered by police officers as­signed to certain individuals and companies for guard or escort duty. The current lead­ership recognises the need to not only deploy these officers for critical police assignments but also to overhaul the process and deployment of personnel responsible for VIP protection. “By doing so, they aim to restore the dignity of police personnel and elevate the over­all reputation of the Nigerian Police Force (NPF). The withdrawal of PMF personnel from VIPs and the establishment of the Special In­tervention Squad align with the broader objective of fostering a more inclusive and effective se­curity framework that caters to the needs of all Nigerians, rath­er than a select few,” he said. POLL He explained strategic shift underscores the importance of providing equal access to se­curity services for all citizens, thereby enhancing the safety and well-being of the Nigerian populace as a whole. To ensure transparency, accountability, and successful implementation of the with­drawal process, he said a com­mittee headed by the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of operations has been entrusted with overseeing the transition. “This committee will work in close collaboration with rel­evant stakeholders, including VIPs, to address any concerns and challenges that may arise during the process, while safe­guarding the interests and secu­rity requirements of all parties involved. “In addition, the exploration of supernumerary officers as part of this initiative aligns with the provisions set forth in the Police Act 2020. “This legal framework al­lows VIPs to employ individu­als for their personal security and have them trained by the police as supernumerary offi­cers. This approach not only provides VIPs with dedicated security personnel but also ensures that these individuals undergo proper training and adhere to the professional stan­dards set by the police,” the Ag. IGP said. IGP Egbetokun said the in­troduction of the Special Inter­vention Squad will bolster the operational capacity of the Po­lice Force to respond swiftly and effectively to emerging security challenges across the country. He said, “Equipped with specialised training and ade­quate resources, this unit will be capable of handling critical situations and providing rapid assistance wherever neces­sary. The establishment of this squad demonstrates the IGP’s unwavering dedication to en­suring the safety and security of all Nigerians.”
