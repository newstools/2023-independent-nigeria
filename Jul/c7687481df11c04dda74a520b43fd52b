With increasing global pressure on companies to improve on their progress towards sustainability targets by focusing on growing their Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) capabilities, most organisations have come to appreciate the importance of ESG for their businesses. Ola Williams, Country Manager, Microsoft Nigeria, who made the above submission, noted that these organisations have moved towards adopting ESG goals, incorporating targets such as net zero emissions, being water positive and zero waste as well as adopting other long-term sustainability goals. According to her, to move their sustainability agenda, organisations need to not only set sustainability targets but also track them as well. “You can’t progress with what you can’t measure. The challenge, however, is that many businesses lack the timely, accurate access to the information they need to monitor their sustainability efforts, with fragmented data sitting in silos across the organization. It can be difficult to unify and consolidate this information into one sustainability scorecard or keep track of progress against their goals year on year. “Organizations need more accessible and centralized data intelligence to make the decisions that are required to address these complex issues, weighing both business and ESG criteria to direct capital towards investment opportunities that balance growth and impact.” Williams explained that though it is important to identify opportunities to reduce energy consumption and emissions, that it is also critical to adopt integrated systems to facilitate the transition to clean energy. She narrated that as Microsoft itself has found out, that for most organisations, it won’t be a straight forward path as it will require some degree of flexibility as markets and energy infrastructures beyond their control change.
