Chelsea have announced the signing of Diego Moreira from Benfica, quickly following on from the addition of Alex Matos earlier on Saturday. Moreira is currently involved with Portugalâ€™s under-21 side at the European Championships in which Levi Colwill, Noni Madueke and Mykhailo Mudryk are competing. The 18-year-old winger has already made his senior debut for Benfica, making his debut in May 2022 against Pacos de Ferreira. However, the bulk of his experience has come for their B team in 2022/23 and also in the UEFA Youth League.
