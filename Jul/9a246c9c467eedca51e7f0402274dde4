FootMercato have reported that Manchester United are in advanced talks to sign Andre Onana from Inter Milan, who are now trying to sign Hugo Lloris from Tottenham Hotspur to replace the Cameroonian. The Mirror have reported that former Ajax star Onana is expected to complete a move from Inter to United for Â£50 million. Could Hugo Lloris leave Tottenham Hotspur?In our opinion, there is a very good chance that Hugo Lloris could leave Tottenham Hotspur for Inter Milan in the summer transfer window. The French goalkeeper has already publicly said that he wants a new challenge. And Spurs recently signed goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario from Empoli in the summer transfer window. Inter are one of the biggest clubs in the world who reached the final of the UEFA Champions League last season. The Nerazzurri will aim to win Serie A and go far in the UEFA Champions League next season as well. A move to Inter could be hugely appealing for the 36-year-old Lloris, who can still play at the highest level for two more years at least.
