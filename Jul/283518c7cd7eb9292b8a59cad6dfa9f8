Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos state Gover­nor has said that his administration is committed to providing easy access to safe water and hygiene, not just because it is expected of the adminis­tration, but because it is a fundamental human right and it falls within the wel­fare policy for the State. Sanwo-Olu who was represented by Dr. Kadri Obafemi Hamzat, his Dep­uty stated this while speak­ing at the 4th Lagos Inter­national Water Conference (LIWAC) held at the Eko Hotels and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos on Wednesday with the theme; “Attaining Sanitation and Hygiene for All in Lagos State Megacity through Regulation and In­novation” “It is also by this index of sanitation that our dear State will be adjudged for livable suitability, and en­sures that we achieve the SDG target six which will in turn announce our utmost readiness for local and inter­national investments. He said since the incep­tion of the LIWA Conference in the year 2020, the state has sought to reposition water governance and regulatory dispensation in the state, improve water security and investment opportunities. “Our commitment is in line with this administra­tion’s goal of improving ac­cess to clean water and san­itation. The megacity status of Lagos State and the pace at which our population is growing underscores the urgent need to promote and facilitate efficiency in the water sector, as well as guaranteeing its financial viability. “It has been estimated that Lagos by 2050 will hit a population of 40million, hence it has become crucial that we get in front of this issue and come up with sus­tainable strategies that will provide safe water sanita­tion and ensure better hy­giene for the people of the State. The Governor said that the state’s commitment to improving access to clean water and sanitation is hinged on four initiatives, which include: provision of public toilets and bathroom, in each Local Government/ Local Council Development Area, construction of com­munity waste water treat­ment plants, develop our in­tegrated waste management system, expanding and pro­tecting water sources to im­prove the city’s water supply. Funke Adepoju, Execu­tive Secretary of the Lagos State Water Regulatory Commission (LASWARCO) while speaking said due to the constant population growth, particularly in the last couple of decades, wa­ter, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure development has fallen far short of the re­quirements for the current population in spite of huge capital investments in the sector.
